<p>In this short video I report on some of the construction work I keep
doing in and around the hut. Today, I spent about four hours to
install a second-hand balcony door I acquired. I placed it on a side
of the wall that was unfinished and was held together by an OSB panel.
I still have a lot of work to do, but the most important part of
setting things up is done.</p>
