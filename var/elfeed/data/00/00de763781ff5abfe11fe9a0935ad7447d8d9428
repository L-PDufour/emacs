<p>At <a href="https://akademy.kde.org/2025/">Akademy 2025</a>, the
KDE Project <a
href="https://floss.social/@kde/115157115844689060">released</a> an
alpha version of <a href="https://kde.org/linux/">KDE Linux</a>, a
distribution built by the project to "<q>include the best
implementation of everything KDE has to offer, using the most advanced
technologies</q>". It is aimed at providing an operating system
suitable for home use, business use, OEM installations, and more
"<q>eventually</q>". For now there are many rough edges and missing
features that users should be aware of before taking the plunge; but
it is an interesting look at the kind of complete Linux system that
KDE developers would like to see.</p>
