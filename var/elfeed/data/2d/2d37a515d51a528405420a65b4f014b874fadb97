<p>Despite its name, the <a href="https://www.ros.org/">Robot
Operating System</a> (ROS) is not an operating system; it is
a software development kit (SDK) that provides building blocks for
robotic applications. One of the main goals of ROS is to present a
common API that abstracts away the details of particular hardware
drivers or algorithms to make development easier; developers can focus
on what a robot should do rather than the low-level details of
specific controllers. The latest release of ROS, <a

Kaiju</a>, features improvements to the middleware layer that is used
to deliver data between components.</p>
