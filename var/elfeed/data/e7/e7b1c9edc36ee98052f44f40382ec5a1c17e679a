<p>I'm making a more focused effort to juggle this year. Mostly <a href="https://youtu.be/PPhG_90VH5k?si=AxOO65PcX4ZwnxPQ&t=49" target="_blank">boxes</a>, but also classic balls too.<sup id="fnref:boxes"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:boxes">1</a></sup> I've gotten to the point where I can almost consistently do a five-ball cascade, which I <em>thought</em> was the cutoff to being a "good juggler". "Thought" because I now know a "good juggler" is one who can do the five-ball cascade with <em>outside throws</em>. </p>
<p>I know this because I can't do the outside five-ball cascade... yet. But it's something I can see myself eventually mastering, unlike the slightly more difficult trick of the five-ball mess, which is impossible for mere mortals like me. </p>
<p><em>In theory</em> there is a spectrum of trick difficulties and skill levels. I could place myself on the axis like this:</p>
<p><img alt="A crudely-drawn scale with 10 even ticks, I'm between 5 and 6" class="newsletter-image" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/8ee51aa1-5dd4-48b8-8110-2cdf9a273612.png?w=960&fit=max"/></p>
<p>In practice, there are three tiers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Toddlers</li>
<li>Good jugglers who practice hard</li>
<li>Genetic freaks and actual wizards</li>
</ol>
<p>And the graph always, <em>always</em> looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="The same graph, with the top compressed into "wizards" and bottom into "toddlers". I'm in toddlers." class="newsletter-image" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/04c76cec-671e-4560-b64e-498b7652359e.png?w=960&fit=max"/></p>
<p>This is the jugglers curse, and it's a three-parter:</p>
<ol>
<li>The threshold between you and "good" is the next trick you cannot do.</li>
<li>Everything below that level is trivial. Once you've gotten a trick down, you can never go back to not knowing it, to appreciating how difficult it was to learn in the first place.<sup id="fnref:expert-blindness"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:expert-blindness">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Everything above that level is just "impossible". You don't have the knowledge needed to recognize the different tiers.<sup id="fnref:dk"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dk">3</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>So as you get better, the stuff that was impossible becomes differentiable, and you can see that some of it <em>is</em> possible. And everything you learned becomes trivial. So you're never a good juggler until you learn "just one more hard trick".</p>
<p>The more you know, the more you know you don't know and the less you know you know.</p>

<p>A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem? <a href="https://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html" target="_blank">(src)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this applies to any difficult topic? Most fields don't have the same stark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line" target="_blank">spectral lines</a> as juggling, but there's still tiers of difficulty to techniques, which get compressed the further in either direction they are from your current level.</p>
<p>Like, I'm not good at formal methods. I've written two books on it but I've never mastered a dependently-typed language or a theorem prover. Those are equally hard. And I'm not good at modeling concurrent systems because I don't understand the formal definition of bisimulation and haven't implemented a Raft. Those are also equally hard, in fact exactly as hard as mastering a theorem prover.</p>
<p>At the same time, the skills I've already developed are easy: properly using refinement is <em>exactly as easy</em> as writing <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/what-are-the-rosettas-of-formal-specification/" target="_blank">a wrapped counter</a>. Then I get surprised when I try to explain strong fairness to someone and they just don't get how □◇(ENABLED〈A〉ᵥ) is <em>obviously</em> different from ◇□(ENABLED 〈A〉ᵥ).</p>
<p>Juggler's curse!</p>
<p>Now I don't actually know if this is actually how everybody experiences expertise or if it's just my particular personality— I was a juggler long before I was a software developer. Then again, I'd argue that lots of people talk about one consequence of the juggler's curse: imposter syndrome. If you constantly think what you know is "trivial" and what you don't know is "impossible", then yeah, you'd start feeling like an imposter at work real quick.</p>
<p>I wonder if part of the cause is that a lot of skills you have to learn are invisible. One of my favorite blog posts ever is <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/blub/" target="_blank">In Defense of Blub Studies</a>, which argues that software expertise comes through understanding "boring" topics like "what all of the error messages mean" and "how to use a debugger well".  Blub is a critical part of expertise and takes a lot of hard work to learn, but it <em>feels</em> like trivia. So looking back on a skill I mastered, I might think it was "easy" because I'm not including all of the blub that I had to learn, too.</p>
<p>The takeaway, of course, is that the outside five-ball cascade <em>is</em> objectively the cutoff between good jugglers and toddlers.</p>

<p>Rant time: I <em>love</em> cigar box juggling. It's fun, it's creative, it's totally unlike any other kind of juggling. And it's so niche I straight up cannot find anybody in Chicago to practice with. I once went to a juggling convention and was the only person with a cigar box set there. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:boxes" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
