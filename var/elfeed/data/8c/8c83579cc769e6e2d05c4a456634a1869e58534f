The GNU Tools Cauldron is almost entirely focused on user-space tools, but
kernel developers need a solid toolchain too.  In what appears to be a
developing tradition (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/990379/">started in 2024</a>),
some kernel developers attended the <a
href="https://conf.gnu-tools-cauldron.org/opo25/">2025 Cauldron</a> for the
second year in a row to discuss their needs with the assembled toolchain
developers.  Topics covered in this year's gathering include Rust, better

format (BTF)</a> support, SFrame, and more.
