        <p>Reclaiming Your Windows Boot Option: A Comprehensive Step-by-Step
Solution for GRUB Dual-Booters to Restore the Windows Entry and
Achieve Seamless System Switching.</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>After significant updates, it is not uncommon to encounter an issue
where the "Windows" entry is missing from the GRUB bootloader
menu. Technically, this issue arises when the os-probe utility fails
to run, preventing the automatic addition of extra Operating Systems,
especially in cases of dual-boot configurations.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>To resolve this issue and restore the "Windows" entry in the GRUB
bootloader menu, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the <code>/etc/default/grub</code> file with root privileges. You can do
this using a text editor like nano or vim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locate the following line in the file and uncomment it by removing
the # symbol at the beginning of the line:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-unknown"><code class="language-unknown"># If your computer has multiple operating systems installed, then you
# probably want to run os-prober. However, if your computer is a host
# for guest OSes installed via LVM or raw disk devices, running
# os-prober can cause damage to those guest OSes as it mounts
# filesystems to look for things.
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false</code></pre></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Save the changes to the file and close the text editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the following command to update the GRUB configuration:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-unknown"><code class="language-unknown">sudo update-grub</code></pre></div>
<p>This command will regenerate the GRUB configuration file with the
necessary changes.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>After running the update-grub command, you will see output similar
to the following:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-unknown"><code class="language-unknown">Generating grub configuration file ...

Its output will be used to detect bootable binaries on them and create new boot entries.

<p>This indicates that the Windows partition has been detected, and a new
entry for it has been added to GRUB.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Finally, reboot your system using the following command:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-unknown"><code class="language-unknown">sudo reboot</code></pre></div>
<p>After rebooting, you should see the "Windows" option restored to your
GRUB bootloader menu.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you can efficiently address the issue of the
missing "Windows" entry in GRUB and ensure a smooth dual-boot
experience on your system.</p>
