Klint</a> is a Rust compiler extension
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/951550/">
developed by Gary Guo</a> to run some
kernel-specific lint rules, which may also be useful for embedded system
development. He spoke about his
recent work on the project at
<a href="https://kangrejos.com/">
Kangrejos 2025</a>. The next day, Alejandra Gonz√°lez
led a discussion about Rust's normal linter,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/clippy/index.html">
Clippy</a>. The two tools offer complementary approaches to analyzing Rust
kernel code, although both need some additional direction and support from
kernel developers to reach their full potential.
