Emacs elevator pitch

</p>

<p>
That's the theme for the <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/08/01/emacs-carnival-2025-08-your-elevator-pitch-for-emacs/">August Emacs Carnival</a>.
</p>

<p>
I don't spend much time in elevators these days, and I didn't talk much to strangers even during the before-times.
</p>

<p>
So let's imagine this is more of, say, a meetup. (Someday I'll get back to going to those.) Could be tech, could be something else. Could be online, could be in person.
</p>

<p>
I don't have to convince everyone. I don't even have to convince a single person.
My goal is to listen for the tinkerers: the ones who like to ask "Why?" and "What if?" and who try things out.
They're interesting.
</p>

<p>
I can find them by:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>watching talks (sketchnotes are a great thank-you gift)</li>
<li>eavesdropping or asking questions</li>
<li>sharing what I'm tinkering with</li>
</ul>

<p>
No: Why would anyone do that?
Yes: Have you thought of trying xyz?
</p>

<p>
For tinkerers, the juice might be worth the squeeze.
Emacs can be challenging, but it can also pay off. It can even be fun.
</p>

<p>
Even when I find a fellow tinkerer, the conversation isn't "Have you tried Emacs? You should try Emacs."
It'll probably be more like:
</p>

<p>
"I'd love to keep hearing about your experiments. Do you have something I can subscribe to or follow?"
(Side-quest: Try to convince them to blog.)
</p>

<p>
and then the conversation can unfold over time:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Ooh, I like that idea. Here's my take on it."</li>
<li>"How did you do that? What's that?!"</li>
<li>"Oh, yeah, Emacs. It's very programmable, so I can get it to do all sorts of stuff for me. Wanna see?"</li>
</ul>

<p>
&hellip;and sometimes they fall into the rabbit hole themselves, as tinkerers often do.
But even if they don't try Emacs (or don't stick with it), cross-pollination is great.
And sometimes Emacs changes their life.

To get a sense of the kinds of things someone has gotten Emacs to do, check out <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-elevator-pitch">Alvaro Ramirez's post</a>. I have a list like that at <a href="https://sachachua.com/topic/emacs">emacs</a>. On the topic of cross-pollination, I like Jeremy Friesen's EmacsConf 2023 talk on <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/mentor/">Mentoring VS-Coders as an Emacsian (or How to show not tell people about the wonders of Emacs)</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's always fun to come across a fellow <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/emacs-users-are-like-igor/">tinkerer</a>. I love seeing what people come up with. Emacs works out really well for tinkerers. It's not just about taking advantage of the technical capabilities (and you can do a surprising amount with text, images, and interaction), it's also about being part of a great community that's in it long-term. Good stuff.
