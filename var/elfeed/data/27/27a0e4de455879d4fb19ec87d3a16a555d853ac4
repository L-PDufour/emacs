<p>I know I said we'd be back to normal newsletters this week and in fact had 80% of one already written. </p>
<p>Then I unearthed something that was better left buried.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hillelwayne.com/post/javascript-puzzle/" target="_blank">Blog post here</a>, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/blog-notes-124153641" target="_blank">Patreon notes here</a> (Mostly an explanation of how I found this horror in the first place). Next week I'll send what was supposed to be this week's piece.</p>
<p>(PS: <a href="https://www.aprilcools.club/" target="_blank">April Cools</a> in three weeks!)</p>
