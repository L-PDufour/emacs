The openSUSE project has <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/9032de2a-03a7-4f9e-9c8a-8bd81c5d1fc5@suse.cz">announced</a>
that the bcachefs filesystem will be disabled in its kernel builds starting
with 6.17; bcachefs users will have to make other arrangements.  "<q>The
current 6.16.* is NOT affected. Neither is Slowroll (for now).</q>"
