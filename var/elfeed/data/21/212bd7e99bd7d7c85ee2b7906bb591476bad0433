<h3>The Future of Qooxdoo</h3><p>Have you been wondering what&#39;s happening in qooxdoo land, and if there will ever be a version 6 release? I can tell you now, there will! Just as it is with most projects, they often take a little longer than expected. We are mostly done with the coding, but the documentation and website still need some more attention before we are ready to make a splash. In any event, you can try the new qooxdoo now.</p><p>We have been paying close attention to not break code that worked on qooxdoo 5.0, so you should be fine with upgrading your existing application to the new qooxdoo release. The compiler is now written in JavaScript and can be installed via npm. We have a great new contrib system and some cool new toys, like an event recorder and a modern looking theme. More on these later.</p><p>For starters, try setting up the compiler and creating a little demo app. Behold the npm installation awesomeness:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/599/1*wR-DycdlTQGOY4KjN_VSIA.gif" /><figcaption>qx compiler Installation demo</figcaption></figure><pre>$ mkdir qxdemo <br>$ cd qxdemo/ <br>$ npm i @qooxdoo/compiler @qooxdoo/framework<br>$ npx qx create qxdemo --out . --type desktop --noninteractive<br>$ npx qx serve</pre><p>After running the above, navigate your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></p><p>Alternatively, if you don’t mind answering a bunch of interactive questions, you can get away with even less typing:</p><pre>$ npm i -g @qooxdoo/compiler @qooxdoo/framework<br>$ qx create qxdemo<br>$ cd qxdemo<br>$ qx serve</pre><p>If you feel like helping, see us on <a href="tps://gitter.im/qooxdoo/qooxdoo">gitter</a>!</p><p><em>Update 2019–05–14:</em> new package names in the @qooxdoo namespace.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=939348406c73" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://news.qooxdoo.org/the-future-qooxdoo-939348406c73">The Future Qooxdoo</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.qooxdoo.org">Qooxdoo News</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
