<p>Cary Coutant has <a
href="https://groups.google.com/g/generic-abi/c/doY6WIIPqhU/?pli=1">announced</a>
a <a href="https://gabi.xinuos.com/">draft for version 4.3</a> of the
Executable and Linking Format (ELF) object file format. The
specification was formerly part of the <a
href="https://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/gabi40.pdf">Unix System
V Release 4 (SVR4) gABI document</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The last published gABI documents were the Fourth Edition and a draft
of Edition 4.1, both published in March 1997. The ELF portions of the
document were updated several times between 1998 and 2015, published
online [...]</p>

<p>I've published the last draft from 2015 as Version 4.2, and collected
the several changes since then, along with new e_machine values, as
Version 4.3.</p>

<p>The source for the draft is on <a
href="https://github.com/xinuos/gabi">GitHub</a> in <a
href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html">reStructuredText</a>
format, and Coutant has collected the mailing list discussions for
changes in 4.3 as <a

issues</a>. Thanks to Jose E. Marchesi for the tip.</p>
