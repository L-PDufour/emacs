<p>The <strong><a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/enhanced-evil-paredit.el">enhanced-evil-paredit</a></strong> package prevents parenthesis imbalance when using <em>evil-mode</em> with <em>paredit</em>. It intercepts <em>evil-mode</em> commands such as delete, change, and paste, blocking their execution if they would break the parenthetical structure. This guarantees that your Lisp code remains syntactically correct while retaining the editing features of <em>evil-mode</em>.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3>What are the differences between enhanced-evil-paredit and evil-paredit?</h3>
<p>The <code>enhanced-evil-paredit</code> package is a modernized version of <code>evil-paredit</code>. It has been enhanced and fully functions in recent versions of Emacs (Emacs &gt;= 28). The author decided to develop <code>enhanced-evil-paredit</code> because the <code>evil-paredit</code> package is no longer maintained and does not function in recent versions of Emacs and Evil.</p>
<p>Here are the enhancements in <code>enhanced-evil-paredit</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handles paste using <code>p</code> and <code>P</code>, ensuring that the pasted text has balanced parentheses.</li>
<li>Fix call to a non-existent function <code>(evil-called-interactively-p)</code>, which has been replaced by <code>(called-interactively-p 'any)</code>.</li>
<li>Add new functions: <code>enhanced-evil-paredit-backward-delete</code> and <code>enhanced-evil-paredit-forward-delete</code>.</li>
<li><code>enhanced-evil-paredit-mode</code> only uses the paredit functions when paredit is enabled. Otherwise, <code>enhanced-evil-paredit-mode</code> uses Evil functions.</li>
<li>Add lexical binding with <code>lexical-binding: t</code>.</li>
<li>Suppress Emacs Lisp warnings and add Melpa tests.</li>
<li>Refactor and improve <code>enhanced-evil-paredit</code>.</li>
<li>Create a <code>enhanced-evil-paredit</code> customization group for user configuration.</li>
<li>Remove Evil state change from <code>enhanced-evil-paredit-mode</code>.</li>
<li>Improve error handling in <code>enhanced-evil-paredit-check-region</code>.</li>
<li>Enhance docstrings.</li>
<li>Remove keymap bindings that are reserved by Emacs.</li>
<li>Add <code>&amp;optional</code> after the <code>end</code> argument to make it similar to Evil functions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><code>dd</code> restores the column when there is a parentheses mismatch.</li>
</ul>
