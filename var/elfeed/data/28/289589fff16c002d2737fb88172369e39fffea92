<p>In this ~22-minute video I show the back side of my hut. Today I
cleared the wild vegetation there and created a few raised garden
beds. The next task is to plant vegetables on the garden beds. I also
show the part of the land that is adjacent to the stream and describe
the ongoing flood-control work I am doing there.</p>
