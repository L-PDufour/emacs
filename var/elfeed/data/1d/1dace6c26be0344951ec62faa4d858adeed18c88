<p>This week on the C committee mailing list we had a discussion about how C&#8217;s types are organized into different categories. At the end I came up with a diagram with that organization. It basically translates the section &#8220;<strong>6.2.5 Types</strong>&#8221; of the C23 standard into a graph of inclusions. </p>

<p>Sorry, it is probably a little bit too wide for your phone, but by opening it on a computer screen or a laptop in a separate window and using the zooming feature of your browser you should be able to discover its parts. Annotations give the paragraph number in that clause of the C23 standard.</p>



<p>There is some minor color coding:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Special cases of additions to certain categories are noted with a red arrow</li>



<li>Inclusions that are not mentioned explicitly in the standard but that follow from the extent of the underlying set of types are dashed blue.</li>



<li>Type correspondence where a type or type category is used to define another are dotted lines. </li>



<li>Narrow integer types that are promoted (usually to <code>int</code>) are in dark green.</li>
</ul>
