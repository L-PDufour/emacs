Learn how to upgrade your packages with care and precision, rather
than blindly.</p>
<h2>Interactive Package Upgrades</h2>
<p>Yarn offers a powerful feature: the ability to upgrade your packages
interactively. This means you can selectively choose which packages to
update while also getting a sneak peek at their compatibility status.</p>
<p>To utilize this feature, run the following command in your terminal:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">yarn</span> upgrade-interactive
</code></pre></div>
<p>This command will display a color-coded list of all available upgrades, where:</p>
<p>Red indicates a major update with potentially backward-incompatible changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yellow signifies a minor update, typically introducing backward-compatible features.</li>
<li>Green represents a patch update, often addressing backward-compatible bug fixes.</li>
<li>You can now use the spacebar to select the packages you wish to
upgrade and confirm your selections by pressing Enter.</li>
</ul>
<p>For additional guidance and more information, you can refer to the official documentation <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/upgrade-interactive/">here!</a></p>
<p>Upgrading your Node.js project doesn't have to be a daunting
task. With Yarn's interactive package upgrade feature, you can
approach it methodically, ensuring that you only update what you need
while staying informed about compatibility changes. By making use of
this powerful tool, you'll not only streamline your development
process but also reduce the chances of unexpected issues arising
during upgrades. So, remember to upgrade with care and precision, and
let Yarn's interactive upgrades be your trusty companion in
maintaining a healthy and up-to-date Node.js project.</p>
