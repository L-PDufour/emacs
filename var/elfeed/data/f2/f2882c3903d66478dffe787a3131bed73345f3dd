I recently saw this <a href="https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1961172409920491849">Tweet by John Carmack</a> about developing new operating systems. Carmack is of the opinion that it&rsquo;s rarely justifiable and when it is, &ldquo;[Y]ou practically need an isolated monastic order of computer engineers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
I don&rsquo;t have an opinion on the matter and I&rsquo;m willing to concede that either side of the argument may be right so this post isn&rsquo;t about that. Rather, what caught my attention was this remark by Carmack about his strenuous objections to a plan by Meta to build XROS, a new operating system:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
They also got me reported to HR by the manager of the XROS effort for supposedly making his team members feel bad&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

Did you get that? Some reputedly grown up engineering manager went crying to Mom because someone was saying mean things that made him and his team feel bad. If you&rsquo;re a parent, you&rsquo;ll be familiar with this behavior from your five year olds but you&rsquo;re probably expecting better from your colleagues.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, this behavior is wider spread than you&rsquo;d expect. I remember a friend of mine getting reported to HR because his keyboard was too loud. The complainers didn&rsquo;t talk to him and try to resolve things. They just went running to Mom.

<p>
I don&rsquo;t know about you but I find this sort of behavior revolting. Grow up for goodness sake. It&rsquo;s been a long time since you were five.</p>
