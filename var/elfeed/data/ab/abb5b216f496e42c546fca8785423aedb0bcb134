<p>Would you rather that <code>git checkout</code> got a lot faster at checking out a lot
of files, and <code>git add</code> got a lot faster at adding a lot of small files, if
the tradeoff was that <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit -a</code> got slower at adding
large files to the annex than they are now?</p>

<p>Being able to make that choice is what I'm working on now. Of course,
we'd rather it were all fast, but due to
<a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/git_smudge_clean_interface_suboptiomal/">git smudge clean interface suboptiomal</a>, that is not possible
without improvements to git. But I seem to have a plan that will
work around enough of the problems to let that choice be made.</p>

<p>Today I've been laying the groundwork, by implementing git's
pkt-line interface, and the long-running filter process protocol.
Next step will be to add support for that in <code>git-annex smudge</code>,
so that users who want to can enable it with:</p>

<pre><code>git config filter.annex.process 'git-annex filter-process'
</code></pre>

<p>I can imagine that becoming enabled by default at some point in v9, if most
users prefer it over the current method. Which would still be available
by unsetting the config.</p>
