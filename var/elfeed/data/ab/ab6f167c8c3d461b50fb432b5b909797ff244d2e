        <p>The 0.3.0 release of <a href="https://github.com/LionyxML/emacs-kick">Emacs
Kick</a> lands today, bringing
quiet but quality-of-life improvements while paving the way for future
support in Emacs 31.</p>
<p>Gone is the <code>company-mode</code> UI. Enter: <code>corfu</code>, floating tooltips, rich
font support, and more predictable behavior. Whether you use Emacs in
GUI or terminal, the UX feels tighter, more modern, and (if you're on
Emacs 31) frankly beautiful.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs walk through what changed, and why this matters.</p>
<hr>
<h2>‚ú® What's New in 0.3.0</h2>
<p>This release is focused on simplifying and modernizing the core
experience‚Äîparticularly <strong>completion</strong> and <strong>inline documentation</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>üß† Corfu replaces Company</h3>
<p><code>company-mode</code> has served us well, but it‚Äôs showing its age. In 0.3.0,
it‚Äôs replaced with <a href="https://github.com/minad/corfu"><code>corfu</code></a>.</p>

<p>This:</p>
<p>‚ûñ Easily supports <strong>Nerd Fonts</strong> icons on TUI.</p>
<p>‚ûñ Provides info about completion candidate on TUI (Emacs >31).</p>
<p>‚ûñ Feels native and snappy.</p>
<p>‚ûñ Integrates beautifully with <code>cape</code>, <code>vertico</code>, <code>orderless</code>, the modern minibuffer stack.</p>
<p>‚ûñ Plays nice with LSP and non-LSP backends alike.</p>
<p>Corfu stays out of your way until you need it. Completion is now
<strong>manual by default</strong>, triggered via <code>TAB</code>. No more random popups
mid-thought.</p>
<p>You can re-enable auto-completion if you prefer, but the default now
gives you back control.</p>
<h3>üí° Floating Eldoc (with eldoc-box) on Emacs 31</h3>
<p>If you're running the bleeding-edge Emacs 31, you now get floating
documentation (via child-frame) out of the box using eldoc-box.</p>
<p><img src="https://rahuljuliato.com/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fblog%2Fposts%2Femacs-kick-030-01.png&w=3840&q=75" alt="emacs-kicks-eldoc-box"></p>
<p>That means pressing <code>K</code> (uppercase!) shows a clean, floating doc
tooltip right next to your point.</p>
<p>No more jumping to temporary buffers to read type signatures or
docstrings. It feels like a native IDE. And if you‚Äôre still on Emacs
30? No problem, the fallback is still the <em>eldoc</em> buffer.</p>
<h3>‚ú® Smaller Tweaks That Matter</h3>
<p>True to the Emacs spirit, small details make a big difference. This
release includes several subtle but impactful visual and behavioral
changes:</p>
<p>‚ûñ <strong>Company Mode Removed</strong>: All <code>company-mode</code> related packages have
been fully removed for a cleaner, Corfu-native experience.</p>
<p>‚ûñ <strong>Consistent <code>TAB</code> Behavior</strong>: <code>TAB</code> is now exclusively for
completion, removing the ambiguity where it might trigger
indentation instead.</p>
<p>‚ûñ <strong>Quicker Dired</strong>: <code>&#x3C;leader> e d</code> now opens dired on current
working directory. This complements <code>&#x3C;leader> e e</code> which opens the
side explorer.</p>
<p>‚ûñ <strong>Cleaner Diffs</strong>: The markers used by <code>diff-hl</code> in the margin have
been updated to clearer box-drawing characters (<code>‚îÉ</code>, <code>‚îÜ</code>), making
it easier to see new, modified, and saved changes.</p>
<p>‚ûñ <strong>Iconic Magit</strong>: When you have Nerd Fonts enabled, your Magit
status buffer now includes file-type icons, giving it a richer,
modern feel.</p>
<p>‚ûñ <strong>Less Noise</strong>: The automatic highlighting of the current line
(<code>global-hl-line-mode</code>) is now off by default to reduce visual
distraction.</p>
<h3>üöÄ What This Means for You</h3>
<p>Remember this:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">Emacs-Kick isn‚Äôt a full-fledged distribution
but rather a starting point for building your
own Emacs configuration. It‚Äôs designed to be
especially accessible for Vim/Neovim users,
letting you explore the power of Emacs without
committing to its entire ecosystem.</code></pre></div>
<p>This release doubles down on that. It gets out of your way. It gives
you just enough: snappy completions, modern visuals, but no monolithic
frameworks.</p>

<h3>üí¨ Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>This release makes Emacs Kick feel... well, kick-ass. It‚Äôs smoother,
quieter, and more intentional. If you value clean defaults, fast
completion, and less cognitive noise. You‚Äôll feel the difference.</p>

<p>Happy hacking! ‚ö°Ô∏è</p>
