The Linux kernel has to handle many different sources of data that should not
be trusted: user space, network connections, and removable storage, to name a
few. The kernel has to remain secure even if one of these sends garbled (or

that makes it harder to accidentally make decisions based on data from user space. That work
is now on its

fourth revision</a>, and Lossin has asked kernel developers to experiment with
it and see where problems remain, making this a good time to look at the proposed API.
