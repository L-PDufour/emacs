<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The programming languages (PL) community has developed a whole host of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mentoring pillars </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to help new research become a part of our community</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW), our 1-2 day workshop before each of our four flagship conferences, answers: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I make the most of a conference? How do I start as a programming languages researcher?</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SIGPLAN-M, our international, long-term mentor-matching program, addresses: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I grow as a researcher within the community? How do I navigate critical transitions like applying to graduate school, deciding a thesis topic, or managing a conflict with an advisor?</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLTea, one of our social planning organizations: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I form my network of researchers?</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one key piece is missing here: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how do I </span></i><b><i>present</i></b> <b><i>my</i></b> <b><i>specific</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Presenting research—writing a paper, iterating on feedback, building a slide deck, and quickly pitching your project—are almost required skills to make your research visible. However, by default, opportunities to present research come near the conclusion of a project which might take anywhere from a couple of months to more than a year and without practice, it is hard to hone these skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how can we design a mentoring pillar for the PL community that provides junior researchers access to high-quality expert feedback and an opportunity to practice their presentation skills without needing to conclude multi-year projects?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Research Competition</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stated goal of an ACM SRC is to be a “unique forum for undergraduate and graduate students to present their original research before a panel of judges and attendees at well-known ACM-sponsored and co-sponsored conferences.” ACM SRCs are separated by undergraduate and graduate students and have three components:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short abstract submission</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poster presentation at the conference for the selected abstracts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short conference-style presentation for semifinalists</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per ACM rules, each of the latter two steps must be judged (and given feedback from) at least 3 Computer Science professionals (with PhDs) unaffiliated with the contestant. For PL conferences, the abstracts are reviewed by a Program Committee (PC) of PhDs, the same as any of our conferences. The student winners in both the undergraduate and graduate categories go on to compete in the ACM Grand Finals, where students submit five-page papers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ostensibly, the SRC covers every part of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">presenting</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research: students need to write papers on their individual contributions, design posters to pitch their work to area experts, and give high-quality talks. Unfortunately, SRCs generally suffer from several challenges that make it hard for them to provide the kind of feedback students would need to improve their presentation skills.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Difficult Balancing Act</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SRCs are pitched as a research </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">competition</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indicating externally that the program committee cares only for the highest-quality, polished research. For people within the community, SRC is often viewed as a low visibility forum, which means mentors rarely encourage their mentees to submit to it. We view this dichotomy as the core issue with the SRC: the “competition” portion of the forum is not visible enough to warrant the best submissions and the feedback mechanisms are not always robust enough to be useful in the research process for junior students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our proposal to revamp the SRC more broadly is focused on two goals:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refocus the SRC to be a </span><b>feedback-oriented </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">forum by providing high-quality feedback from experts in the community.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the SRC research </span><b>more visible </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the community.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some overlapping communities are already closer to these ideals—for example, the </span><a href="https://2024.splashcon.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPLASH 2024 SRC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3689491#sec2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">archival proceedings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> encouraging authors to write high-quality submissions. In our friendly neighboring community of SIGARCH, several major architecture conferences have a </span><a href="https://web.mit.edu/yarch2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YArch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (“Young Architect”) workshop. YArch sits at an interesting sweet spot between PLMW and our current SRC: junior graduate and research-active undergraduate students must submit papers to be accepted, and each submission receives detailed feedback from experts with PhDs both before the workshop and in person during it. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concrete Changes for PLDI SRC 2025</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As co-chairs of this year’s SRC at PLDI 2025, we plan to make the following changes:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Program committee size</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We will recruit more experts with PhDs to join the SRC Program Committee. If you have (or will have by June) a PhD and you consider yourself part of the PLDI community, please consider filling out </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18UsOz8mv1xvwz6e4_ZkTJMgOo6Z0pnzZPXLo9QMlOl4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our nomination form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! You can also nominate your collaborators and friends.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Archival extended abstracts and shepherding</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Accepted abstract submissions (3 pages, double column) to the SRC will be included in the PLDI 2025 proceedings.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Each accepted submission will be assigned a shepherd from the program committee, who will help summarize the committee’s suggested changes and provide additional writing feedback to the student prior to the camera ready.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pre-submission guidance. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous SRC chairs have noted that students are sometimes unsure if their work even qualifies for submission to the SRC. We have a </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ld0IumrCzM5z7ip6RF85PKPKtdoHM-8fqAM4M9XOBAM/edit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">simple Google form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that students can fill out to get in touch with the SRC chairs and have these questions answered. If you are a student uncertain about your work, please reach out to us!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Highlight the SRC winners. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the most recent PLDI, SRC winners were presented at the banquet rather than the business meeting, which we think was a positive change. We plan to further increase SRC visibility by saying a few sentences about why the judges selected each winning project. We will also note if any undergraduate or masters student winners are planning to apply to PhD programs in the near future. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Continue to push for travel/registration funding via SIGPLAN PAC. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would like to move to a model where the </span><a href="https://pac.sigplan.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SIGPLAN PAC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> secures funding for the SRC for students who otherwise could not attend, rather than this falling to individual conference organizers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We intend these changes to be preliminary and we have an explicit goal to not increase the amount of work per SRC committee member. We will report on our experience of running the PLDI 2025 SRC with these changes to inform the community on how to best utilize the SRC in the future. Our goal is to maximize the effectiveness of the SRC in building up the communication skills of the next generation of programming language researchers. While we have already initiated conversations with previous SRC chairs across the programming languages community, if you have thoughts about the limitations or challenges for the SRC, please reach out to us!</span></p>
