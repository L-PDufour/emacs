<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>This new edition has been the occasion to overhaul the presentation in many places, but its main purpose is the update to the new C standard, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/82075.html">C23</a>. The goal was to publish this new edition of Modern C at the same time as the new C standard goes through the procedure of ISO publication. The closest approximation of the contents of the new standard in a publically available document can be found <a href="https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3220.pdf">here</a>. New releases of major compilers already implement most of the new features that it brings.</p>
<p>Among the most noticeable changes and additions that we handle are those for integers: there are new bit-precise types coined <code>_BitInt(N)</code>, new C library headers <code>(for arithmetic with overflow check) and</code> (for bit manipulation), possibilities for 128 bit types on modern architectures, and substantial improvements for enumeration types. Other new concepts in C23 include a <code>nullptr</code> constant and its underlying type, syntactic annotation with attributes, more tools for type generic programming such as type inference with <code>auto</code> and <code>typeof</code>, default initialization with <code>{}</code>, even for variable length arrays, and <code>constexpr</code> for named constants of any type. Furthermore, new material has been added, discussing compound expressions and lambdas, so-called “internationalization”, a comprehensive approach for program failure.</p>
<p>Also added has been an appendix and a temporary include header for an easy transition to C23 on existing platforms, that will allow you to start off with C23 right away.</p>
<p>Manning’s early access program (MEAP) for the new edition is still open at</p>

<p>Unfortunately they were not yet able to tell me when their version of the C23 edition will finally be published.</p>
