<html><head></head><body>Some of the habits I use Beeminder for are maintaining a journal and weighing myself. The way I do these things is that I have a few capture templates with a nonempty :after-finalize property set to a lambda which sends a datapoint to Beeminder. The problem is, it also sends its datapoint if I press C-c C-k, effectively canceling the entry. How to make it not do so?</body></html>
