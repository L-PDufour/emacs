                                <p>To celebrate Symfony’s 20th anniversary, we’re creating something special: <strong>a comic book!</strong> 📖</p>

<p>This unique project will bring Symfony’s story to life — from its very first steps to the global framework it is today. Packed with fun facts, milestones, and behind-the-scenes anecdotes, the book will be a playful tribute to two decades of innovation, community, and unforgettable moments.</p>

<p>But we can’t do it alone. We’re looking for community members and partners to help make this project a reality. By supporting the Symfony comic book, you’ll not only help celebrate this milestone but also associate your brand with the legacy, creativity, and spirit of the Symfony Open Source community.</p>

<p>🗨️ Sponsorship Opportunities:</p>

<p>We’re offering three levels of sponsorship: <strong>Bronze</strong> – exclusively for freelancers, <strong>Silver</strong> and <strong>Gold</strong>.</p>

<p>Depending on the level, sponsors will receive recognition through some of the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your logo displayed on a dedicated acknowledgement page in the book</li>
<li>A clickable logo in the PDF edition and on the order website page</li>
<li>Thank you messages on Symfony’s social media channels and blog post</li>
</ul>

<p>The comic book will be officially released in <strong>November</strong> at <a href="https://live.symfony.com/2025-amsterdam-con/">SymfonyCon Amsterdam 2025</a>⚡with a print run of 1,500 copies. It will only be available in English at a price of 40€ (PDF or printed book).</p>
