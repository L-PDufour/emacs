<p data-bo="208">The most popular option to decompress ZIP files from the Rust programming
language is a crate simply named <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/zip" id="zip">zip</a> — At the time of this writing, it has 48
million downloads. It’s fully-featured, supporting various compression methods,
encryption, and even supports writing zip files.</p>

<p data-bo="528">However, that’s not the crate <em>everyone</em> uses to read ZIP files. Some
applications benefit from using asynchronous I&#x2F;O, especially if they decompress
archives that they download from the network.</p>
