<html><head></head><body><p>You may or may not have noticed that I’ve been posting over at my experimental WordPress blog at <a href="https://baty.blog">baty.blog</a>. I wish I had a good explanation for it, but I don’t. It may be that my current foray into using Linux has caused a bit of keyboard-and-text-only fatigue. I mean, it’s been all day in a terminal or TUI or NeoVim for everything. I have been dealing with sync and config and updates and so on. By the time I go to write something on the blog, I’ve lost the mood, so I’ve been clicking “New Post” in my browser, typing a bit, dragging and dropping an image or two, and clicking the Publish button. It’s kind of a relief, honestly.</p>
<p>I still dream of <a href="https://baty.net/posts/2025/09/how-to-have-only-one-blog/">having only one blog</a>, but until I stop being so moody about it, that feels unlikely. I started this post just to see if I was back in the mood for Emacs/Hugo. I apologize for my continued tendencies to jump all over the place. I know it’s annoying. In the meantime, I’m writing mostly here, or over at <a href="https://baty.blog">baty.blog</a>, or on <a href="https://rudimentarylathe.org">the wiki</a>.</p>
