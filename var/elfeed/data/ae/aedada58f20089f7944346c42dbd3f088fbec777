<p><strong>UPDATE 2025-09-25 13:51 +0300:</strong> The original used “words..in

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Continue
to put letters
in bottles
and toss them
to the waves
until
years later
on second read
you realise
your messages
were being sent
