<html><head></head><body><p>At long last, I have completed some final edits on the version 2 of my <a href="https://chris-maiorana.kit.com/products/emacs-for-writers">Emacs For Writers handbook.</a></p>
<p>I had mentioned that I was going to write a sequel edition with more advanced tips and tricks.&nbsp; Instead, I decided to augment the existing book. This way, if you have already downloaded it you can get the updated version by using your same link.</p>
<p>Included in this edition:</p>
<ul>
<li>More “file organization” theory</li>
<li>Notes on advanced note-taking</li>
<li>Tracking deadlines and other writerly metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, in addition to the original PDF version I’ve thrown in an ePub edition suitable for e-readers. And, of course, it’s all DRM-free.</p>
