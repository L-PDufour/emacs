<html><head></head><body><p>Welcome to my first free software activities report, a monthly series
in which I aim to summarize my activities in the free software
projects and communities I participate in.</p>
<h2>GNU &amp; FSF</h2>
<ul>
<li>EmacsConf: I submitted a proposal to talk about <a href="https://kelar.org/~bandali/2025/08/31/emacsconf-2025-gnus-proposal.txt">reading and writing
emails in GNU Emacs with Gnus</a> for EmacsConf 2025.  This year marks
the 10th anniversary of my involvement in EmacsConf, but I’ve yet to
give a talk at the conference, so I thought it would be nice to try
and change that.  I’m happy that my proposed talk has been accepted
by my fellow organizers and volunteers who review the proposals.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>GNU Spotlight: I prepared and sent the August edition of the monthly
GNU Spotlight to the FSF campaigns team, who will review and publish
it on the FSF’s community blog and as part of the next issue of the
monthly Free Software Supporter newsletter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Debian</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://bugs.debian.org/1070268">#1070268</a>: I recently noticed that the recutils package is missing
in the latest release of Debian, Trixie.  Indeed, recutils’ page on
the tracker shows that it was removed from testing last year due to
FTBFS bug <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/1066370">#1066370</a>, and its maintainer requested it be adopted by
someone else in this bug.  This is unfortunate, because there are
other pieces of software (including other GNU packages) that rely on
recutils, and the GNU Project also uses recutils extensively for
various record-keeping purposes.</p>
<p>So I reached out to the package’s former maintainer Sven Wick, who
gave their kind blessing for me to adopt it.  I’ve adopted recutils
in Debian with an upload that also addresses the FTBFS bug.</p>
<p>Many thanks, Sven, for your years of work packaging and maintaining
recutils in Debian!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://bugs.debian.org/1066370">#1066370</a>: Fixed FTBFS bug in recutils and uploaded to unstable.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Devuan</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git.devuan.org/devuan/documentation/pulls/13">devuan/documentation#13</a>: Prepared screenshots of the installation
steps for use in the upcoming Excalibur release’s installation
guide.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Misc</h2>
<ul>
<li>doric-themes: I contributed a tiny patch (<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/doric-themes/commit/cea178c9f15454acf1cc022b0e9020fb24d61d2d"><code>cea178c</code></a>) to tweak the
appearance of the <code>diary</code> and <code>org-agenda-diary</code> faces to make them
stand out more.</li>
</ul>
