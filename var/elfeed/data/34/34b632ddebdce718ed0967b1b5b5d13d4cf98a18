<p>As you may know I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_Fantasy_Battle">Warhammer Fantasy Battles</a> table top game. I have written about it on <a href="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/tag/warhammer/">more than one occasion</a> and I made a tiny web service allowing you to print <a href="http://www.pdfmovementtray.com/">custom paper movement trays / proxy sheets</a>. I own not one, not two, but three armies for the game. That&#8217;s easily hundreds of dollars worth of miniatures. More if you consider most of my dwarfs are classic Marauder models that have been out of production for over two decades now. I have been playing the game since around 1995. I started with the 4<sup>th</sup> edition and I am no stranger to the changes in the game mechanics and balance. I endured the 5<sup>th</sup> edition <em>Hero Hammer</em> power escalation, and the subsequent global nerf and rule reset in the 6<sup>th</sup>. The most recent 8<sup>th</sup> edition has turned to be the last one.</p>

<p>During the massive and aptly named <cite>End Times</cite> campaign, Games Workshop officially destroyed the Warhammer Fantasy universe. And no, that&#8217;s not a metaphor: the campaign literally ended in gigantic magic battle that resulted in the annihilation of the entire universe. But some gods did some magic stuff, and the universe would be reborn after the cataclysm. Only it would be new and different. This was supposed to allow Games Workshop to shake up the 23 year old setting, add new factions, create new alliances and do some clever re-branding (<acronym title="Games Workshop">GW</acronym> was always upset they could not trademark words like Elf, Dwarf or Empire). The 9<sup>th</sup> edition of the game was supposed to be all new and all different which was&#8230; Intriguing. As much as I bemoaned loss of two decades of lore and world building efforts, I was rather interested to see the brand new setting. Especially since I never used any special characters in my armies. My collection was not strictly bound to the Old World lore, and could be easily ported to the new setting if needed.</p>
<div id="attachment_18674" style="width: 608px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/delf.jpg"><img src="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/delf.jpg" alt="Dark Elves" width="598" height="333" class="size-full wp-image-18674" srcset="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/delf.jpg 598w, http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/delf-480x267.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Part of my Dark Elf Army.

<p>Unfortunately, the 9<sup>th</sup> edition never came. Instead, Games Workshop released a brand new, skirmish game called <cite>Age of Sigmar</cite>. The new game looks and plays entirely different from the venerable twenty year old <cite>Warhammer Fantasy</cite>. For one, it eschews the concept of unit block. In <acronym title="Warhammer Fantasy Battles">WFB</acronym> the models used square bases (usually 25mm to the side) so that they could be arranged in ranks and columns. Square or rectangular blocks of roughly 20-60 troops would move together as one entity. You would usually place the entire unit on an appropriately sized <em>movement tray</em> and then slide the trays across the table. The units could perform <em>wheel</em> maneuvers to turn, or <em>reform</em> to change the number of ranks or do an about face. <cite>Age of Sigmar</cite> threw all of that out. It uses round bases and all models move individually, though units should stay in 1&#8243; cohesion if they are able to.</p>

<p>Games Workshop did provide <cite>Age of Sigmar</cite> rules for all the <cite>Warhammer Fantasy</cite> models they currently sell in their online store. That said, all the game mechanics were re-tooled to focus on individual models, and low model count battles. Templates and guess range weapons are gone. All ranges were shortened to support smaller, more spread out armies. For example, Dwarf cannons in the 8<sup>th</sup> had a maximum effective range of up to about 70&#8243;. The same model under <cite>Age of Sigmar</cite> rules can only shoot 32&#8243; and is vastly less effective.</p>
<p>The game replaces the 8<sup>th</sup> edition, but it does not seem to be interested in actually being a replacement of any sort. Instead it seems to be positioned to compete with with Privateer Press <cite>Warmachine</cite> (another low scale, low model count fantasy skirmish game) rather than with Mantic Games <cite>Kings of War</cite> (which focuses on unit blocks like WFB did). The new starter set has less than 20 models to the side, with powerful heroes being the main focal point of the battles and rank and file troops being just a filler. There is a dedicated <em>Hero Phase</em> in which powerful characters trigger their signature abilities. This is very similar to <cite>Warmachine</cite> which focuses on powerful Warcasters and their magically powered, clockwork Warjack machines &#8211; of which you only ever field a handful. Both games seem to favor small engagements with few powerful models on the table.</p>
<div id="attachment_18676" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/warmachine.jpg"><img src="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/warmachine.jpg" alt="Warmachine" width="600" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-18676" srcset="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/warmachine.jpg 600w, http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/warmachine-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is a legal Warmachine starter army.  That&#8217;s all the models you need.</p></div>
<p>But <cite>Age of Sigmar</cite> can&#8217;t hope to compete with Privateer Press product (save maybe on model quality or pricing), because <cite>Warmachine</cite> is designed from ground up to be a competitive tournament game. It has balancing mechanics that ensure opponents will always play with equally powerful forces. <cite>WFB</cite> had a similar mechanic. <cite>Age of Sigmar</cite> has none. The rulebook for the game which is four pages long, and <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/age-of-sigmar-compendiums">available as a free download</a> from the GW website specifically encourages players to bring any models they want. There are no point costs, no unit size limits, no limits on optional upgrades. The only limit is how much you are willing to spend on the miniatures. The only balancing mechanic is the fact that the player who is outnumbered by 30% gets to pick a victory condition.</p>
<p>But that rule in itself seems inconsistent and easy to abuse, since you compare forces on raw model count, even though models are not equal in power. For example a player fielding 5 of the brand new, vastly overpowered medieval Space Marines accompanied by 3 special characters, each riding a dragon will be outnumbered by someone fielding a single unit of 10 rank and file goblins with no characters. Horde armies such as Skaven or Goblins that in the past relied on superior numbers to offset relatively weak core troops are now punished for fielding large armies. On the other hand players who field few special characters and no troops at all are rewarded.</p>

<p>If you wanted to make a small local tournament in <cite>WFB</cite> you could put out a flyer or a poster that said something like: &#8220;1,500pts, no special characters, no magic items over 50pts&#8221; and it would force people to bring balanced, characterful armies built around core units. The players would have to figure out how to build forces of specified size that leveraged the strengths of their chosen army while at the same time minimizing its flaws. They would have to think about unit positioning, protecting their flanks, synergies between units and leaders and etc.. In <cite>Age of Sigmar</cite> this is no longer possible. Since there is no point costs and no size limits on units, it is impossible to ensure any kind of balance.</p>
<p>Allegedly there exist these top secret, unofficial basic balancing rules released by disgruntled GW game developers through back channels, but even those don&#8217;t help much:</p>

<p>To put it simply, <cite>Age of Sigmar</cite> is not a competitive tournament game. Which would be fine, if that was it&#8217;s only flaw. I&#8217;m not much of a competitive player myself, and I much prefer casual play with friends than tournament play with strangers. But I do like game balance and structure, as much as I like my ranked up unit blocks and my movement trays. And I would like an option to play a tournament from time to time if I wanted to. <cite>Age of Sigmar</cite> does not support that. But if GW wanted to make a game that is strictly casual and non-competitive and friendly then so be it. Unfortunately the game is not designed to be either friendly or inviting.</p>
<p>Games Workshop products and lore has always been a tad problematic. Back in the day the Warhammer lore included monsters whose <a href="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2014/04/07/bizarre-bestiary-fimir/">reproductive cycle involved kidnaping and rape</a>. Their sculptors always had issues creating female models <a href="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2014/08/11/picking-a-dark-elf-sorceress-adventures-in-male-gaze/">without objectifying and sexualizing them</a>. But those were minor problems compared to the new rule set.</p>
<p><cite>Age of Sigmar</cite> is a game that throws away the idea of good sportsmanship out the window and encourages players to hurl insults at each other in order to receive mechanical bonuses:</p>

<p>Yep, making the environment hostile, uncomfortable and facilitating abuse and bullying is a codified game mechanic. Abso-fucking-lutely brilliant, GW. good luck marketing this particular warscroll to parents whose children want to get into the war gaming hobby. Especially since the streamlined, simplified, non-competitive rule set definitely skews younger.</p>
<p>There is another rule that encourages players to give and accept bribes in exchange for in-game effects. Because adding a gambling mechanic into a core rule set is a splendid idea that will never actually backfire:</p>

<p>I can see this particular rule being used by players to body shame younger boys for not having enough body hair, or young girls for having some fuzz on their upper lip. Because making someone feel like shit about their own body is awesome, and sportsman like, is it not?</p>
<p>Some rules are just plain goofy. Bretonian players for example can get mechanical bonuses for rising a cup into the air, and screaming out a catchphrase:</p>

<p>I get what they were trying to do with these rules. They were trying to encourage players to have &#8220;fun&#8221; with their games. But you can&#8217;t codify fun as a game mechanic. People scream <q>Blood for the blood god!</q> when charging not because they will get a buff, but because its fun, silly and spontaneous thing to do. Codifying it as a mechanic makes it forced and awkward. Doubly so if the game tells you to do something you are not comfortable with: like insulting your friend, or mocking insanity. It is one thing to have a &#8220;mad count&#8221; type character in the lore, it is a whole other thing to encourage players to &#8220;pretend to be a crazy person&#8221;. It&#8217;s uncalled for, and it ignores the fact many Warhammer players may personally know people who struggle with mental illness, or may have one themselves.</p>
<p>It amazes me that no editor realized that these rules might not only be upsetting, but even damaging to the Games Workshop brand. But that&#8217;s sort of my general impression of the entire rule set. It seems to be hastily put together without much oversight. Its like none of these rules were play tested, or focus tested to see how they will perform in the field.</p>
<p>Many people are really excited for this new game. Folks in my Twitter feed and on reddit are already posting pictures of their models on round bases, and writing up first battle reports. Sadly, I don&#8217;t share their enthusiasm. <cite>Age of Sigmar</cite> is not for me. I like the <cite>WFB</cite> focus on unit blocks and core troops, I like my movement trays, I don&#8217;t like powerful hero characters that dominate the battlefield. I like balance and structure, and building armies using a spreadsheet and a calculator. The new rules do nothing for me. They are overly simplistic, and too goofy to be taken seriously. I also don&#8217;t feel comfortable playing or endorsing a game which encourages players to insult each other or mock mental illness.</p>
<p>Most of people in my gaming group share these opinions, so we will be sticking to the good old 8<sup>th</sup> edition. While it isn&#8217;t perfect, it is pretty damn good and we enjoy it. It&#8217;s sad that it won&#8217;t be supported by Games Workshop anymore. This means that it will be more difficult for use to replace damaged rulebooks, and near impossible to convince new players to join the hobby. But the bittersweet takeaway from all of this is that <cite>Age of Sigmar</cite> means Games Workshop won&#8217;t be able to ruin the mostly well balanced and sound 8<sup>th</sup> edition rule set. We can continue playing the game as it exists right now, without worrying about rule changes, power creep, getting our favorite units nerfed and etc..</p>
