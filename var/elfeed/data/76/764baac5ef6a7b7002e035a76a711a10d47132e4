<p>I just published the book “Emacs Lisp Elements”. It is available for
free and in freedom under the same terms as all documentation that
ships with GNU Emacs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Official page: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/emacs-lisp-elements">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/emacs-lisp-elements</a></li>
  <li>Git repository: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/emacs-lisp-elements">https://github.com/protesilaos/emacs-lisp-elements</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I provide a big picture view of the Emacs Lisp programming language by
combining prose with code. The goal is to give readers an idea of how
Elisp works by showing some of the main concepts or patterns
discernible in everyday code.</p>

<p>Some chapters are beginner-friendly, while others dive into deeper
waters. Though I think everything is still approachable, as I try to
explain basic concepts and take things one step at a time.</p>

<p>The book is not meant to be a replacement for the built-in Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual. It simply gives you enough information to reason
about Elisp. Once you start extending Emacs, the rest will follow
naturally.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it and continue to have fun with Emacs.</p>
