<html><head></head><body><p>I’m writing this in Vim. Or, more specifically, NeoVim. Am I doing it because I don’t like Emacs? Of course not. Sometimes it’s just fun to use something else. I like to try everything.</p>
<p>Whenever I criticize Emacs or even simply use something else, I get comments about how I’m somehow wrong in doing so. How silly.</p>
<p>We’d be better off not lashing our identities to the software or hardware we use, I say.</p>
