<html><head></head><body><p>I use Emacs for practically everything at my day job so it’s no
surprise that I would get around to incorporating my work calendar

work.  I’ve written a lot of tools in Emacs for work; some of them
turn out to be not very useful, but integrating my work calendar has
been a net positive to my workflow.</p></body></html>
