In a nice followup <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13296">to yesterday’s post on Casual BibTeX</a>, Charles Choi has another post on easily capturing a Web link to your BibTeX file. The idea is that you’re looking at some paper or other information in your Web browser and want to capture the reference to your BibTeX file.
</p>
<p>
The method works by abusing the Org protocol mechanism to deliver capture template information to a BibTeX file rather than an Org file. It’s really simple to set up. You merely add the capture template that Choi provides to your list of capture templates and you’re good to go.
</p>
<p>
It’s not completely automatic. You still have to specify the Author and Organization when prompted in the minibuffer but it’s <i>much</i> easier than entering all the information by hand and you have the advantage the the BibTeX schema will be respected.
</p>
<p>
If, like a lot of people, you locate your references on the Web, Choi’s trick will save you some time and effort. To be sure, it’s not as powerful as John Kitchin’s <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=4818">Org-Ref</a> but as a simple method of capturing a BibTeX entry from the current Web site, it’s perfect. If you need more, take a look at the Org-Ref video linked above to get an idea of how far you can push the Web site to BibTeX idea.</p>
