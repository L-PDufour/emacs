<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code> are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU
Emacs that provide colourful (“pretty”) yet legible options for users
who want something with a bit more flair than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code> (also
designed by me).</p>

<h2>Version 1.11.0 on 2025-09-25</h2>

<p>This version introduces minor refinements to a stable package.</p>

<h3>Support for faces added to Emacs 31</h3>

<p>Emacs 31 is the current development target of Emacs. The new faces are
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">header-line-inactive</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package-mark-delete-face</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package-mark-install-face</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minibuffer-nonselected</code>.</p>

<h3>Mode lines are a bit easier to spot</h3>

<p>The active and inactive mode lines now have a subtle box/border around
them on graphical Emacs. In non-graphical sessions, an underline is
applied instead. This makes mode lines easier to stand out even when
the buffer is showing a background that is of a similar colour to
their own background.</p>

<h3>The Custom interface buttons are more refined</h3>

<p>These are the buttons that appear in the Custom buffers that we reach
through various means such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x customize</code>. Like with the mode
lines, they use a box/border around where possible, else fall back to
an underline.</p>

<h3>The current date in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x calendar</code> always looks the same</h3>

<p>Before, it would look different if the Calendar was produced via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x
calendar</code> as opposed to the Org date selection interface. This is
because they apply different faces to the current date. Those are now
reworked to look the same.</p>

<h3>Notmuch message summary headers have clear dividers</h3>

<p>In the Notmuch email client, the messages in a thread can be
collapsed/minimised to just a heading. Those used to have only a
subtle background, which would be enough to differentiate them from
the body of the email but not from each other when all were collapsed.
Now the themes add an overline to each heading, if supported by the
underlying display engine (i.e. graphical Emacs), which should make it
easier to spot them.</p>

<h3>Links in the header line of Info buffers do not have an underline</h3>

<p>This is because the header line has a distinct background already, so
we want to avoid exaggerations.</p>

<h3>The commands <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-rotate</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-load-random</code> can be silent</h3>

<p>They now accept an optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SILENT</code> parameter that inhibits the
message they otherwise print. Thanks to Sean Devlin for the
contribution in pull request 59: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/pull/59">https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/pull/59</a>.</p>

<p>Note that any function can be silenced with something like this:</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">my-wrapper-of-some-function</span> <span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">inhibit-message</span> <span class="no">t</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">some-function</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
