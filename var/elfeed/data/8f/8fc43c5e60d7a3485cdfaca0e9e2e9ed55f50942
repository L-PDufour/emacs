<p>The Alpine Linux project has <a
href="https://alpinelinux.org/posts/2025-10-01-usr-merge.html">announced</a>
plans to change its base filesystem hierarchy:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>In the future, <tt>/lib</tt>, <tt>/bin</tt>, and <tt>/sbin</tt>
will be symbolic links to their <tt>/usr</tt> counterparts, and every package
shall be installed under the <tt>/usr</tt> paths. For now,
<tt>/usr/bin</tt> and <tt>/usr/sbin</tt> will continue to be independent paths,
but that might change if the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) gets
updated.
</blockquote>

<p>The merge will take place in the upcoming Alpine&#160;3.23 release
planned for November; non-merged systems will be considered
unsupported when 3.22 is at its end of life in May 2027.</p>
