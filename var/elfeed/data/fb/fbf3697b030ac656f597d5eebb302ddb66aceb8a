The x-axis represents age ranging from 20 to 80, and the y-axis shows the number of discoveries. The purple curve (1935-1965) peaks sharply around age 37, while the green curve (post-1965) peaks more broadly. Annotations indicate that the burden of knowledge increased after 1965, requiring more time to master fields." width="800" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11037" srcset="https://informationisbeautiful.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SM-IIB-Peak-Age-Scientists-SQ.png 2161w, https://informationisbeautiful.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SM-IIB-Peak-Age-Scientists-SQ-480x480.png 480w, https://informationisbeautiful.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SM-IIB-Peak-Age-Scientists-SQ-960x960.png 960w, https://informationisbeautiful.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SM-IIB-Peak-Age-Scientists-SQ-150x150.png 150w, https://informationisbeautiful.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SM-IIB-Peak-Age-Scientists-SQ-768x768.png 768w, https://informationisbeautiful.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SM-IIB-Peak-Age-Scientists-SQ-1600x1599.png 1600w, https://informationisbeautiful.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SM-IIB-Peak-Age-Scientists-SQ-1200x1199.png 1200w, https://informationisbeautiful.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SM-IIB-Peak-Age-Scientists-SQ-240x240.png 240w, https://informationisbeautiful.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SM-IIB-Peak-Age-Scientists-SQ-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://informationisbeautiful.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SM-IIB-Peak-Age-Scientists-SQ-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
