Auto-Dark, Crafting a Perfectly Tailored and Eye-Pleasing Coding
Experience. We hope you found this guide enjoyable and useful. If you

<h2>What is auto-dark ?</h2>
<p>In today's digital world, the interface of your preferred text editor
plays a crucial role in your productivity. As developers and writers,
we often spend long hours staring at our screens, and it's essential
that our tools are easy on the eyes. One vital aspect of this is
choosing the right color scheme, or theme, for your text
editor. However, we all know that our surroundings change throughout
the day, and we want our tools to adapt to those changes as well. This
is where Auto-Dark for Emacs comes into play.</p>
<p>Auto-Dark is a nifty Emacs package available via MELPA that ensures
your Emacs environment changes its theme based on your operating
system's dark-mode settings. Whether you're using macOS, Linux, or
Windows, this tool seamlessly integrates with your system's
preferences.</p>
<h3>How Does Auto-Dark Work?</h3>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LionyxML/auto-dark-emacs/master/images/demo_gnome.gif" alt="auto-dark-demo"></p>
<p>Auto-Dark simplifies the process of switching between two user-defined
themes that automatically change when your system's dark mode is
toggled on or off. It currently supports Linux through Gnome and
Termux for Android users, with more platforms potentially being added
in the future. The default themes are 'wombat' and 'leuven,' as these
are bundled with Emacs.</p>
<p>Installing Auto-Dark is straightforward. You can easily grab it from
MELPA and add the following lines to your <code>.emacs</code> or
<code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> file:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-lisp"><code class="language-lisp"><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">require</span> <span class="token quoted-symbol variable symbol">'auto-dark</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token car">auto-dark-mode</span> <span class="token boolean">t</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>For more detailed guides, tips, and tricks on setting up Auto-Dark
with <code>Spacemacs</code> and <code>DoomEmacs</code>, you can explore the official Auto-Dark
Emacs repository on GitHub. Here, you'll find comprehensive
documentation and resources to help you get the most out of this handy
package. The repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/LionyxML/auto-dark-emacs">Auto-Dark on
GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The light/dark themes can be customized using the Emacs customization
system: <code>M-x customize-group auto-dark</code>.</p>
<p>Or set directly with:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-lisp"><code class="language-lisp"><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">setq</span> auto-dark-themes <span class="token punctuation">'(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token car">doom-one</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token car">doom-one-light</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Why Catppuccin?</h2>
<p>In the colorful world of code theming, Catppuccin stands as a
testament to the perfect balance between visual aesthetics and
functionality. This community-driven pastel theme is meticulously
crafted to be the sweet spot between low and high contrast
themes. With four soothing "flavors," each offering a palette of 26
eye-catching colors, Catppuccin isn't just for codingâ€”it's a
delightful experience that enhances your designing and much more.</p>
<p>Within the Catppuccin package, you'll discover four distinct
"flavors": Latte, Frappe, Macchiato, and Mocha. Each variant presents
a unique shade, allowing you to choose your preferred level of
contrast, whether you're inclined towards a darker or lighter theme.</p>

<p>Catppuccin isn't just a theme; it's become a substantial project in
its own right. You can explore the expansive world of Catppuccin on
<a href="https://github.com/catppuccin">Catppuccin Repo</a>, where it has left its mark on various
platforms. You might have already encountered Catppuccin on your
terminal emulator, in your tmux configuration, on your Chrome browser,
within your Discord server, and across several code editors. And, of
course, it's made its way into the heart of one of the most beloved
text editorsâ€”Emacs.</p>
<h3>Catppuccin and Emacs: A Perfect Blend</h3>
<p>The Emacs variation of Catppuccin has found a special place in the
hearts of many, including myself. I've had the privilege of
contributing to this project by theming bits of various packages,
such as: Ivy, Popup, Swiper, Counsel, LSP-Mode, Indent-Guide, and
Treemacs. It's a testament to the open-source spirit, where
collaboration and creativity come together to create something truly
exceptional.</p>

<p>Before we wrap up, I'd like to give a shout-out to the fantastic
contributors who have made Catppuccin what it is today. Special thanks
to <a href="https://github.com/NamesCode">@Name</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/nyxkrage">@Nyx</a> for your patience, guidance, and
the joy of collaboration. ðŸ˜„</p>
<h2>Bringing Catppuccin and Auto-Dark Together</h2>
<p>Catppuccin, with its unique theme and variations, uses variable
settings for its flavors. However, these settings don't align
perfectly with Auto-Dark, which expects separate dark and light
themes. To make them work harmoniously, we can leverage the
flexibility of Auto-Dark's hook system.</p>
<p>Here's a snippet to configure the integration:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-lisp"><code class="language-lisp"><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">use-package</span> auto-dark
  <span class="token lisp-property property">:ensure</span> <span class="token boolean">t</span>
  <span class="token lisp-property property">:config</span>
