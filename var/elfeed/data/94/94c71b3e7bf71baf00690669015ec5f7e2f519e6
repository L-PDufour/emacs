Surprisingly, one of Irreal&rsquo;s most popular posts was about writing. Even more surprising, the post was about what dictionary you should be using when writing. That article, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=4190">Draft #4</a>, is from 10 years ago and discusses why you are probably using the wrong dictionary. Hardly the type of thing to engage the mainly nerdy reader of Irreal. Bug engage it did. There weren&rsquo;t a lot of comments but I kept seeing references to it on other blogs, many of them including actionable data on making use of &ldquo;the right&rdquo; dictionary in Emacs.

My post was about an article by James Somers, which in turn discussed an article by the prose stylist, long time New Yorker writer, and Princeton journalism professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee#Selected_essays_and_reporting">John McPhee</a>. If you&rsquo;re interested in improving your writing, I urge you read Somers&rsquo; article and McPhee&rsquo;s New Yorker article that inspired it. Both are linked in my original post.

All this is by way of introducing Somers&rsquo; new article, <a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/the-mcphee-method">The McPhee Method</a>. In it, he describes the extraordinary efforts that McPhee goes to in writing his beautiful prose and unforgettable articles. You should absolutely read Somers&rsquo; article but the TL;DR is that he would spend a huge amount of time with his subjects—sometime several months—just gathering facts and recording them in notes. That&rsquo;s stage 1 of his process. Stages 2 and 3 involve culling and organizing those notes. It&rsquo;s only in Stage 4 that McPhee begins writing. That&rsquo;s a very quick overview of the process. Again, see Somers&rsquo; article for the details.

If you pay attention to tags or are reading this on <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>, you&rsquo;re probably wondering what this has to do with Emacs. You&rsquo;ll have to read Somers&rsquo; piece for the full story but the short answer is that Somers replicated part of McPhee&rsquo;s process by writing <a href="https://gist.github.com/jsomers/ded472b1aa3b92d5fc8b35e92164eb07">some Elisp</a> to leverage Org mode to reproduce McPhee&rsquo;s note filing method. It&rsquo;s another great example of how flexible Emacs is and how it can be used to solve surprising problems.</p>
