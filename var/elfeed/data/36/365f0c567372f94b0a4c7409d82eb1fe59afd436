<html><head></head><body>Fallout 1 is "a post nuclear role playing game" released October 10th, 1997 on DOS, PC, and Mac platforms. Despite its age, it's definitely worth playing nowadays and has a couple of different ways to play on Linux including a native port. In this post, the first of several "Linux Gaming" entries I plan to write, I'll go over why I think the game is so special as well as what options we have for playing it.
