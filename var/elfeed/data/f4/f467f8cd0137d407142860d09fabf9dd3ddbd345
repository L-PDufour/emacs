<p>In this two hour video, I walk to the top of a mountain in my region. I keep a first person view of the scene, to show the environment at this time of the year. As I do this climb, I cover a wide range of topics, including practical philosophy. Ultimately though, this is about exposing ourselves to the subtlety of this world and refining our appreciation of things we could otherwise take for granted.</p>
