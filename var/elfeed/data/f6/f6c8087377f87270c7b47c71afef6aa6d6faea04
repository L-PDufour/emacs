        <p>Are you considering migrating your GitHub repositories to Codeberg but
finding the process daunting? Look no further! In this blog post, we
introduce a powerful solution: the "Github to Codeberg Bulk Migration
Script." This script offers a nice way to transfer your projects from
GitHub to Codeberg, leveraging automation to simplify the process.</p>
<p>In recent years, the landscape of code hosting platforms has expanded
beyond the traditional giants. Codeberg, a community-driven and
open-source alternative to GitHub, has gained traction among
developers seeking a platform aligned with principles of privacy,
transparency, and community governance. In this blog post, we'll
explore how to migrate your repositories from GitHub to Codeberg using
a simple and efficient migration script.</p>
<h2>Why Codeberg?</h2>
<p>Codeberg is indeed a noteworthy alternative to GitHub, particularly
for those seeking an open-source and community-driven platform. Here's
why Codeberg stands out:</p>
<p>• <strong>Open Source Philosophy:</strong> Codeberg operates on an open-source
philosophy, ensuring transparency and fostering a collaborative
environment where developers can freely contribute to projects.</p>
<p>• <strong>Privacy and Data Sovereignty:</strong> Codeberg prioritizes user privacy and
data sovereignty, providing a platform where users have control over
their data and can trust that it won't be exploited for commercial
purposes.</p>
<p>• <strong>Community and Governance:</strong> Codeberg is community-driven, allowing users
to participate in decision-making processes and shape the direction of
the platform. This democratic approach ensures that the platform
evolves in line with the needs and values of its users.</p>
<p>• <strong>Support for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS):</strong> Codeberg is
committed to promoting and supporting free and open-source software,
providing a home for projects that align with these principles.</p>
<h2>Why Bulk Migration Matters</h2>
<p>Migrating repositories one by one can be a tedious and time-consuming
task, especially if you have numerous projects to transfer. Bulk
migration streamlines this process by allowing you to transfer
multiple repositories simultaneously, significantly reducing the time
and effort required.</p>
<h2>Introducing the Migration Script</h2>
<p>This is a bash script designed to simplify the migration of
repositories from GitHub to Codeberg. It automates the migration
process, making it easy to transfer your projects in bulk while
preserving their metadata and access permissions.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Bulk Migration</strong>: The script allows you to migrate multiple
repositories from GitHub to Codeberg simultaneously, saving you
time and effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Customization Options</strong>: You can customize various aspects of the
migration process, including repository selection and description
prefix, to suit your specific requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Error Handling</strong>: The script includes error handling mechanisms
to handle any migration failures gracefully, ensuring a smooth and
reliable migration process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Preparing the Ground</h2>
<p>Before diving into the migration process, you'll need to obtain API
keys from GitHub and Codeberg. Here's how you can do it:</p>
<h3>Obtaining API Key from GitHub</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Visit GitHub Developer Settings</strong>: Go to your GitHub account
settings and navigate to the "Developer settings" section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Create a Personal Access Token</strong>: Click on "Personal access
tokens" and then "Generate new token." Provide a descriptive name
for the token and select the desired scopes (e.g., <code>repo</code> for full
access to repositories). Click "Generate token" to create the
token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Copy the Token</strong>: Once the token is generated, make sure to copy
it immediately. GitHub will not display the token again for
security reasons.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Obtaining API Key from Codeberg</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Access Codeberg Account Settings</strong>: Log in to your Codeberg
account and navigate to the account settings page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Generate Personal Access Token</strong>: In the settings menu, select
"Applications" and then click on "Generate new token." Provide a
name for the token and select the necessary scopes (e.g., <code>repo</code>
for repository access).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Save the Token</strong>: After generating the token, make sure to save
it securely. Like GitHub, Codeberg will not display the token
again, so it's essential to store it in a safe location.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With your API keys in hand, you're now ready to proceed with the
migration process using the "GitHub to Codeberg Bulk Migration
Script."</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Read the Script</strong>: Once downloaded, take the time to thoroughly
read and understand the script
(<code>migrate_github_to_codeberg.sh</code>). It's essential never to run a
script without comprehending its functionality and potential
effects on your system. While the script is provided as a helpful
tool, it comes with no warranties, and understanding its behavior
is critical for a safe and successful migration. Here's what you'll
find in the user configuration section:</p>

<p>Notice it can fail for one or other repository (eg.: it is already
migrated from another script run), but it keeps going until the end.</p>
<p>By following these steps and exercising caution throughout the
process, you can safely and efficiently migrate your repositories from
GitHub to Codeberg using the provided script. Remember to always read
and understand scripts before execution, and proceed with care to
ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>While the script offers a convenient solution for transferring
repositories, there are some limitations to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Repository Quota</strong>: Codeberg limits the number of repositories per
user to 100 by default. If you have more than 100 repositories to
migrate, you'll need to request a higher quota following their
instructions. Additionally, Codeberg mirrors repositories, meaning
that a repository on Codeberg acts as a mirror of the original
repository on GitHub. This may affect certain functionalities, such
as repository forks and pull requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• <strong>API Changes and Improvements</strong>: As with any script utilizing
external APIs, there's a possibility that API endpoints or
functionalities may change over time. Codeberg may also introduce
new features or improvements to their platform, offering better
options for migration. It's essential to keep this in mind and
periodically review and update the script to align with any changes
or enhancements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• <strong>Local Repository Copies</strong>: The migration script only handles the
transfer of repository metadata and contents to Codeberg. Your local
copies of repositories will remain unaffected by the migration
process. After running the script, you'll need to manually add a new
remote for each repository pointing to Codeberg and push the changes
to both GitHub and Codeberg remotes until you feel confident that
the migration is complete.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To add a new remote for a repository and push to both GitHub and
Codeberg remotes using SSH, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1 . <strong>Navigate to Repository Directory</strong>: Open the terminal and
navigate to the directory of the repository you want to migrate.</p>
<p>2 . <strong>Edit <code>.git/config</code></strong>: Open the <code>.git/config</code> file in a text
editor. Add a new remote entry under the <code>[remote "codeberg"]</code>
section with the SSH URL of your Codeberg repository. Here's an
example of how it might look:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-ini"><code class="language-ini"><span class="token section"><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token section-name selector">remote "codeberg"</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span></span>
   <span class="token key attr-name">url</span> <span class="token punctuation">=</span> <span class="token value attr-value">git@codeberg.org:YourUsername/YourRepository.git</span>
   <span class="token key attr-name">fetch</span> <span class="token punctuation">=</span> <span class="token value attr-value">+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/codeberg/*</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>3 . <strong>Save and Close:</strong> Save the changes to the .git/config file and
close the text editor.</p>
<p>4 . <strong>Push Changes:</strong> In the terminal, run the following commands to
push changes to both GitHub and Codeberg remotes:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> push origin master  <span class="token comment"># Push changes to GitHub</span>
<span class="token function">git</span> push codeberg master  <span class="token comment"># Push changes to Codeberg</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Of course you could also do it without checking your config with:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> remote <span class="token function">add</span> codeberg git@codeberg.org:YourUsername/YourRepository.git
</code></pre></div>
<p>Repeat these steps for each repository you've migrated until you feel
confident that the migration process is complete. Or maybe you'll feel
in the mood to hack a script to do it 😉.</p>
<p>As one can see, this script provides a solid foundation for repository
migration, users are encouraged to customize and enhance it according
to their specific use cases and requirements. By leveraging the
script's flexibility, users can optimize the migration process to suit
their individual needs and preferences.</p>
<h2>Deleting API Keys</h2>
<p>After completing the migration process, it's essential to delete the
API keys you generated for GitHub and Codeberg to maintain
security. Follow the respective platforms' instructions to revoke or
delete the API keys from your account settings.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The "GitHub to Codeberg Bulk Migration Script" offers a simple and
efficient solution for migrating your repositories from GitHub to
Codeberg in bulk. By automating the migration process, this script
saves you time and effort while ensuring a seamless transition to
Codeberg. Whether you're migrating a handful of projects or an
extensive portfolio of repositories, this script has got you
covered. Say goodbye to manual migration headaches and embrace the
convenience of bulk migration with this powerful script.</p>
