<p>I am developing two new themes for my minimalistic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-themes</code>
package for Emacs. These combine gold with teal hues. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-beach</code> is
the light theme and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-valley</code> is its dark counterpart. Here are
the screenshots:</p>

<h2>Coming in version 0.4.0</h2>

<p>The character of the themes is well-defined, though I may still make some small tweaks. Expect these and other improvements to be available in the next stable version of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-themes</code>, which I expect to publish some time before the end of August.</p>

<h2>About the Doric themes</h2>

<p>The Doric themes use few colours and will appear monochromatic in many
contexts. They are my most minimalist themes. Styles involve the
careful use of typographic features and subtleties in colour gradients
to establish a consistent rhythm.</p>

<p>If you want maximalist themes in terms of colour, check my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code>
package. For something in-between, which I would consider the best
“default theme” for a text editor, opt for my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code>.</p>
