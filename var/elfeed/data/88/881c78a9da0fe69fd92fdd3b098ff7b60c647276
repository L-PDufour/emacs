<p>As a rule, if a package is shipped with a Debian release, users can
count on it being available, and updated, for the entire
life of the release. If package <em>foo</em> is included in the stable
<span class="nobreak">release&mdash;currently</span> Debian&#160;13
<span class="nobreak">("trixie")&mdash;a</span> user can
reasonably expect that it will continue to be available with security
backports as long as that release is supported, though it may not be
included in Debian&#160;14 ("forky"). However, it is likely that the
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/">Guix</a> package manager will soon
be removed from the repositories for Debian&#160;13 and
Debian&#160;12 ("bookworm", also called oldstable).</p>
