<p>The <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/">Fedora 
Council</a> began a process to create a policy on AI-assisted
contributions in 2024, starting with a survey to ask the community
its opinions about AI and using AI technologies in Fedora. On
September&#160;25, Jason Brooks <a
href="https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/council-policy-proposal-policy-on-ai-assisted-contributions/">published</a>
a draft policy for discussion; so far, in keeping with the spirit of
compromise, it has something to make everyone unhappy. For some it is
too AI-friendly, while others have complained that it holds Fedora
back from experimenting with AI tooling.</p>
