<p>The @linkarzu channel on YouTube covers topics related to NeoVim,
terminal emulators, and Emacs, among others:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@linkarzu">https://www.youtube.com/@linkarzu</a>. They recently had a roundtable
about “NeoVim versus Emacs” in which two members on the side of either
community shared their thoughts and had a fun time together:

<p>Christian, the author of @linkarzu, learnt about me via feedback about
the roundtable and contacted me shortly thereafter. We agreed to have
a video exchange focused on Emacs. The idea is for me to share my
thoughts on the matter and demonstrate my day-to-day workflow.</p>

<p>The live event is for paying members of @linkarzu and can be checked
here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/KD9uiDdQDzI">https://www.youtube.com/live/KD9uiDdQDzI</a> (Thursday, July 31 at
15:00 Europe/Athens). The recording of the video will be available to
everyone shortly afterwards and will be free of charge.</p>

<p>Christian wanted to check with me if this practice is acceptable. I
confirmed that it is fine by me and am looking forward to a nice chat!</p>

<p>Once the video is published, I will also share it on my website.</p>
