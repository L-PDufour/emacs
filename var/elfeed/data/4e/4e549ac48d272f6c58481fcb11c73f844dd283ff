<p>Still a chance to join us for <a href="https://geni.us/IIBLive30thJunBlog" target="_blank">a dazzlingly different night</a> out in London on Monday 30th June with Information is Beautiful founder, David McCandless.</p>
<p>Using the data, graphics and stories at the heart of IIB, David will take audiences on a data-driven tour of the universe, sharing the funniest, most insightful and revelatory stories he’s found hidden in the data and numbers surrounding, maybe drowning, us.</p>
<p><em>“His elegant &#038; often playful infographics bring to life information too complex or abstract to grasp any way but visually”<br />
The Guardian</em></p>
