<p>A few days ago, I took the initiative to start a new “Prot Asks” video
series: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-07-10-prot-asks-chats-videos-proposal/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-07-10-prot-asks-chats-videos-proposal/</a>.
Two days later, I published the first ~1-hour video with Carlos about
Emacs for engineering, free software, and life in Spain:

It was a casual chat and I had a good time.</p>

<p>I already have scheduled meetings for the coming weeks. Expect more
interesting conversations with diverse people from the community.
And—don’t be shy!—join the list if you are interested.</p>

<p>Now I want to elaborate on some common questions or remarks I got.</p>

<h2>You should invite PERSON!</h2>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PERSON</code> is a placeholder for any of the well-known folks
online.</p>

<p>I am not going to personally invite anybody. Not because I do not
respect them, but due to the overarching theme of these videos, which
can be summarised as “equal opportunity”.</p>

<p>Those interested are welcome to contact me. All are treated on the
basis of “first come; first served” and are thus forming a line. I am
not making special accommodations for anyone, which is consistent with
the aforementioned theme.</p>

<p>The reason I am approaching it this way is to give everybody—whether
famous or not—an equal chance to speak their mind and express that
which is peculiar to them.</p>

<h2>Is this an interview?</h2>

<p>No. To me, an interview feels formal and structured. It proceeds along
a predefined path. Whereas “Prot Asks” meetings are casual. I do not
prepare any questions, have no script, and will not be formulaic. I
will go with the flow based on the information you have given me and
what I discern through our exchange.</p>

<p>Instead of an interview, think of it this way: you are at the
restaurant, your friends have not shown up yet, and you start a chat
with the waiter.</p>

<h2>Will you ask private questions?</h2>

<p>No. I do not seek “drama” and am not fond of trick questions. Remember
to think of this as an everyday exchange you can have at a public
space with a friendly fellow.</p>

<p>What I will ask about is matters of interest or ideas. When I do
comment on something remotely personal, is the country you live in.
Though you do not need to be specific in any way. It is just a way for
me to ask generic follow-up questions like, “so you are from Greece,
does this mean you also like café frappé?”.</p>

<h2>I doubt I am interesting to talk to…</h2>

<p>I wager you are fine, no matter your background or status. Everybody
has something unique to share and I am curious to discover what that
is. You focus on what you do. Let each viewer discern their own
interpretation of “interesting” rather than try to anticipate it.</p>

<p>I state this with confidence, from my years doing team sports, to my
university studies, time as a bartender, work at the European
Parliament, and current coaching sessions. All distinct social
settings and dynamics. Give a person a chance to speak their mind and
they feel like they never did before.</p>

<p>Plus, as a philosopher (literally “friend of wisdom”) I have realised
that my role is not to judge at the outset but to learn and to try to
comprehend. This way, I do not fall in the trap of pretending to know
more than I actually do.</p>

<h2>How frequently will you publish a new video?</h2>

<p>Depends on my availability. Right now, the meetings I have scheduled
are for Wednesdays and Saturdays. Remember that I still need to work,
continue my hut project, maintain my Emacs packages, and take care of
the dogs. Plus, there can be bad weather, intermittent connectivity,
and other unforeseen events. So we will see how it goes. I am content
with the current expected cadence.</p>

<h2>Make sure to post it everywhere!</h2>

<p>I suppose you are not familiar with my publications and style. In
short, I only publish on my website. Videos also appear on YouTube,
which is the de facto hosting platform. Then I am off to tend to other
activities and do not bother to ping anybody. I like things to happen
organically. My laissez faire attitude keeps me calm, fresh, and freed
from the distraction of chasing Internet points.</p>

<h2>Let’s talk</h2>

<p>Hopefully this clarifies things. I am always happy to answer any
further questions. Just let me know.</p>
