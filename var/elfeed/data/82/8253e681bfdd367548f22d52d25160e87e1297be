Deadlocks are a constant threat in concurrent settings with shared
data; it is thus not surprising that the kernel project has long since
developed tools to detect potential deadlocks so they can be fixed before
they affect production users.  Byungchul Park thinks that he has developed
a better tool that can detect more deadlock-prone situations.  At the 2025 <a

Source Summit Europe</a>, he presented an introduction to his dependency
tracker (or "DEPT") tool and the kinds of problems it can detect.
