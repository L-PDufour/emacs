	Kelling, age forty-three, has held the role of a board member and a
	voting member since March 2021. The board said of Kelling's
	confirmation: "His hands-on technical experience resulting from his
	position as the organization's senior systems administrator proved
	invaluable for his work on the board of directors. The board is
	confident Kelling is the right person to help the organization
	achieve its long-term goals. His commitment to free software comes
	from a life of exploring ways to exert user control. He has the
