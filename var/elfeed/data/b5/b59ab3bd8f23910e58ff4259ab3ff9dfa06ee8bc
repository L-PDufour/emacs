This is how I currently set up Emacs for C++, as an update to <a href="emacs-cpp-notes.html">Trying to set up Emacs for C++ (2022)</a>.</p>

Goals
</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I'm using Emacs to code for KDE projects, mostly written in C++/Qt.</p>

Dependencies
</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Clangd as the language server, and lsp-mode as the LSP implementation in Emacs. I don't use Eglot because last time I used it it didn't support multiple language servers in one buffer, which is a thing I need.</p></div></div></body></html>
