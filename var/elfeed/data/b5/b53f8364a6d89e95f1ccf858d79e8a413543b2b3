  <p>I thought it would be funny to tell you this. My girlfriend is
visiting Greece soon and I was telling her about you and how much
awesome stuff you make for emacs. I was playing pokemon while
talking about this and then I encountered my first ever shiny
pokemon. I’ve been playing pokemon on and off for about 15 years and
this is the first time. I caught the pokemon and named it Prot since
I was talking about you.</p>

<p>Hahaha, that is amazing!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyways, I hope you don’t find that weird. Wish you the best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I do not find it weird. On the contrary, this is something special
which you care about. I am honoured. Thank you!</p>

<p>Also, I think this is a cute story that I should publish on my
website. I will copy the exchange (your message and my reply), but
will leave out your personal information. Are you okay with this?</p>

  <p>The shiny Pokemon was Aron, by the way. It’s one of my favorites.</p>

<p>Looks great! I admit that I have not kept up with the newer
generations. I like the ones in Super Smash Bros, especially Greninja
and Mewtwo.</p>
