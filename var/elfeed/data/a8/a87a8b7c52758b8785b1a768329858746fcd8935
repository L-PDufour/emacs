<html><head></head><body><p>Earlier today I joined Prot for an episode of his <a href="https://protesilaos.com/prot-asks/">Prot Asks</a> series,
where he talks to folks about Emacs and life in general.  We talked
about free software, free knowledge, the importance of community and
the commons, and life in Canada.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-09-03-prot-asks-amin-emacsconf-gnu-debian-internet-archive-canada/">the episode’s page on Prot’s website</a> for the video recording,
Prot’s summary of our chat, and the links I shared after our call.
