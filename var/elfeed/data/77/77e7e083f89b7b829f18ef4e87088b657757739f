        <p>Speed up your Emacs experience and enjoy quicker startup times with these clever tricks and optimizations.</p>
<h2>Launching Emacs</h2>
<p>As you can see in the image above, I have configured my Emacs to be
fully featured, capable of handling a wide range of tasks.</p>
<p>I use it as an integrated development environment (IDE), a music
player, a note-taking app, a frontend for several daemon services, and
more.</p>
<p>However, this versatility comes at a costâ€”Emacs takes a
significant amount of time to start up due to my preference for
installing packages manually rather than using use-package (the
reasons for this choice could fill another post).</p>
<p>In this context, the "right way" to use Emacs is to take advantage of
its server/client architecture. Essentially, you can run Emacs as a
server and open multiple command-line (CLI) or graphical user
interface (GUI) clients, all of which share the same server instance.</p>
<p>To achieve this, I like to set up a few aliases in my .bashrc file:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">emd</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'emacs --daemon'</span>
<span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">em</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'emacsclient -t'</span>
<span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">emg</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'emacsclient -c'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using these aliases, running <code>emd</code> starts the Emacs server. You only
need to do this once when you start your terminal or set it to run as
a server/daemon on system startup.</p>
<p>The initial startup time is the only downside, but this delay occurs
only once. Afterward, using <code>em</code> opens the full-featured Emacs
instantly. You can even use it to open a specific file like this: <code>em my_file.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, we have <code>emg</code>, which does the same as <code>em</code> but opens a client
in graphical mode.</p>
<p>Any instance opened with <code>em</code> or <code>emg</code> will share the same Emacs server,
allowing you to take advantage of data sharing between different
"sessions."</p>
<p>In conclusion, by harnessing the power of Emacs' server/client
architecture and a few nifty aliases, you can transform your Emacs
experience into a seamlessly versatile tool for your daily tasks. So,
why wait? Dive into the world of efficient, lightning-fast Emacs
sessions, and let your creativity and productivity soar. Happy
hacking!</p>
