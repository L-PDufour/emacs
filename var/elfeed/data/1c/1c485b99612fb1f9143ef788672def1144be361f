<p data-bo="168">My family wasn’t poor by any stretch of the imagination, but I was raised to
avoid spending money whenever possible.</p>

<p data-bo="286">I was also taught “it’s a poor craftsman that blames their tools”, which
apparently means “take responsibility for your fuckups”, but, to young-me,
definitely sounded more like “you don’t deserve nice things”.</p>

<p data-bo="497">I was also taught from an early age that I was born a sinner, incapable of doing
good by myself, and that all the earthly things were temptations, sent by the
devil to corrupt me (further I guess?) but also temporary, and that I shouldn’t
attach myself.</p>
