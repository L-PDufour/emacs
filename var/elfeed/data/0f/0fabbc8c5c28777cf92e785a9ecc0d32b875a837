Here’s a bit of humor that I’ve had sitting in one of my browser tabs for some time. Over on the Emacs subreddit, Hlorri asks you to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1n1knpl/tell_me_you_use_emacs_without_telling_me_you_use/">Tell me you use emacs (without telling me you use emacs)</a>. Although meant to be humorous—and many of the answers <i>are</i> humorous—a lot of them reveal important things about Emacs.
</p>
<p>
The most common humorous answer involves the strength of the user’s pinky. A typical example is, “I thumb wrestle with my pinky.” Another, that I really liked and could relate to was, “My editor’s config file is older than some of my co-workers.” Several offerings involved the wearing away of the text on the CTRL key.

<p>
Among the answers that weren’t so much funny as telling were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I expect to get things done in a single app.</li>
<li>I cannot use essentially any other piece of software without accidentally opening 10 print dialogs or new blank documents/tabs at some point. (and several variations on this theme)</li>
<li>There’s a mixture of awe, confusion, and mystery when I pair program with co-workers.</li>
<li>Whenever someone wants to give me any “advice” I frown.</li>
<li>I interactively do right what other people write programs to do wrong.</li>
<li>I use the same program for e-mails, coding, calendar and keeping notes (and probably much more).</li>
<li>I write utilities in elisp instead of bash.</li>
<li>You mean your code editor doesn’t have a media player, or a planner, or its own window manager?</li>
</ul>
<p>
And a bunch more. Take a look at Hlorri’s post to see them all.</p>
