Nevertheless, there are literally thousands of extension libraries via npm, many of these packages are not node specific and work just fine in the browser.</p><p>The 7.1 release adds functionality to the compiler which detects calls to require and grabs the selected packages from your node_modules folder and integrates them into your qooxdoo application.</p><p>The compiler creates a bundle containing the required packages including all dependencies, and adds that bundle to the JavaScript code that implements your app.</p><p>Using an npm package becomes as simple as installing</p><pre>$ npm install semver</pre><p>and then requiering the package in your qooxdoo app</p><pre>const semver = require(‘semver’)<br>semver.valid(‘1.2.3’) // ‘1.2.3’<br>semver.valid(‘a.b.c’) // null<br>semver.clean(‘ =v1.2.3 ‘) // ‘1.2.3’</pre><p>Enjoy!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=24cc14d7a1d9" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://news.qooxdoo.org/qooxdoo-7-1-24cc14d7a1d9">Qooxdoo 7.1 – easy integration of npm packages</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.qooxdoo.org">Qooxdoo News</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
