Claude Code provides a CLI interface to Claude that maintains full
project context and can execute commands directly. The claude-code.el
package integrates this into Emacs, giving you access to Claude's
capabilities without leaving your editor.</p>

Project Scope Management
</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>Claude Code operates on entire directory trees rather than individual
files. When you start a session from your project root, Claude has
read access to all files in that directory and can understand
relationships between components, build configurations, and test
files.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
