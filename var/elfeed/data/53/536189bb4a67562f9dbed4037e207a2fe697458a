<p>Over the course of the last few weeks, I have been learning qooxdoo and it has been a great experience for me.</p><p>A teammate from <a href="https://webmeisterei.com">Webmeisterei</a> uses qooxdoo for an internal tool, he pointed me to the <a href="http://www.qooxdoo.org/current/pages/desktop/tutorials/tutorial-part-1.html">tutorials</a>. For my first application I have chosen the qooxdoo <a href="http://www.qooxdoo.org/current/pages/desktop/tutorials/tutorial-part-1.html">desktop</a>.</p><p>Qooxdoo comes with a lot of documentation. My favorites are the <a href="http://www.qooxdoo.org/current/">qooxdoo manual</a> the <a href="http://www.qooxdoo.org/current/demobrowser/index.html">Demobrowser</a> and the <a href="http://www.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/">API Viewer</a>.</p><p>With the help of the well written <a href="http://www.qooxdoo.org/current/pages/desktop/tutorials/tutorial-part-1.html">tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://www.qooxdoo.org/current/pages/core/oo_introduction.html">object orientation introduction</a> I got a quick overview of qooxdoos functionality and which impressed me quite a lot.</p><p>Soon after completing that tutorial I found the <a href="https://gitter.im/qooxdoo/qooxdoo">qooxdoo gitter chat</a> where people where very helpful and friendly. Within a week I was able to create <a href="https://drawstack.github.io/qxjoint/">QxJoint</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*heWXiqQycu4Pbsj5dkHY6w.jpeg" /><figcaption>QxJoint, my first qooxdoo app</figcaption></figure><p>I have already started work on my second qooxdoo project: QxPromise.</p><p>Things I don’t like about qooxdoo:</p><ul><li>there is no integration in the js ecosystem</li><li>hard coded paths in config.json</li><li>hard to integrate contributions</li></ul><p>What I love about qooxdoo:</p><ul><li>object orientation</li><li>optimized dependencies with the help of generator.py</li><li>great library design</li></ul><p>My favorite feature of the Demobrowser: The “JS Code” button in the tool bar. Note that if you are working on a small screen, the button may be hidden behind the “next page” button in the top right hand corner.</p><p>I hope you guys have as much fun with the framework as I do.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cd097483e3eb" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://news.qooxdoo.org/learning-qooxdoo-cd097483e3eb">How I learned Qooxdoo in two Weeks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.qooxdoo.org">Qooxdoo News</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
