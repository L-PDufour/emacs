<p>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More
information in the announcement I posted:

<p>For this meeting, I learn from Diego about how he used Emacs to
organise his life and do programming. As the head of an engineering
team, Diego describes how the work is organised and what kind of
considerations are involved. Part of our discussion covers the state
of the industry and the impact of artificial intelligence. We also
talk about life in the countryside of Spain. Diego is into combat
sports, so we cover that issue as well and comment on how it relates
to the human experience more broadly.</p>
