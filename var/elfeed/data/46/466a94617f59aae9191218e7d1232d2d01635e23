It’s September so there’s a new Emacs Carnival. This month the topic is <a href="https://goritskov.com/posts/obscure_packages.html">Obscure Emacs Packages</a>. I have to admit that when I first saw the topic I wasn’t too hopeful that it would be interesting but, of course, I felt the same about the “Elevator Pitch” topic and we all know how obsessed I ended up being with that.
</p>
<p>
Now that I’ve read my first post for the new topic, tusharhero’s <a href="https://tusharhero.codeberg.page/obscure-emacs-packages.html">Obscure Emacs Packages</a>, I guessing that I’m going to end up loving this topic too. Tusharhero’s post actually lists 4 obscure packages—none of which I was familiar with—that many Irreal readers might find useful.
</p>
<p>
By all means, take a look at his post for all the details but I want to mention two of them that I think could be particularly useful. The first is <a href="https://codeberg.org/tusharhero/tinee">Tinee</a> that is an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-everywhere">Emacs Everywhere</a> specifically for Wayland, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13135">which isn’t supported by Emacs Everywhere</a>. The package was written by Tusharhero himself who says it’s not as full featured as Emacs Everywhere but if you’re an Emacs user on a Wayland system, it seems definitely worth taking a look at.
</p>
<p>
The other package is <a href="https://codeberg.org/divyaranjan/emacs-reader">Emacs Reader</a> by Divya Ranjan. It aims to be a complete replacement for PDF-tools and DocView. It’s still in the early stages but Tusharhero says it has “RIDICULOUSLY better performance and smoothness and responsiveness in comparison to both PDF tools and DocView.” It’s still early days for this package but if it lives up to its promise, it will be a package that almost everyone will want.

Take a look at Tusharhero’s post and see if there’s anything there for you.</p>
