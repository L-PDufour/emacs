                                <p>Ryan Weaver was a gifted teacher, a brilliant developer, and a true friend to our
community. In the past days, <a href="https://symfony.com/blog/remembering-ryan-weaver-teacher-core-team-member-friend" class="reference external">we've remembered his kindness, his humor, and the joy he brought</a>
to so many developers around the world. Today, we'd like to honor his legacy in
a special way: <strong>by making all of his Symfony conference talks free to watch</strong>.</p>
<p>While the technical details in these talks may eventually become outdated,
Ryan's unique ability to teach, his infectious enthusiasm, and his remarkable
talent for making complex concepts accessible will remain timeless. This is our
way of ensuring his legacy continues to inspire developers for years to come.</p>

<p>Many of you will remember his iconic talk at <strong>SymfonyCon 2022 in Disneyland</strong>
Paris, where he playfully delivered his talk while dressed as various Disney
characters (<a href="https://live.symfony.com/account/replay/video/672" class="reference external">watch it here</a>).
Or his most recent talk at <strong>SymfonyOnline January 2024</strong>, celebrating the third
anniversary of Symfony UX with the same energy that had defined his career
(<a href="https://live.symfony.com/account/replay/video/915" class="reference external">watch it here</a>).</p>
<p>Ryan's expertise extended far beyond front-end. During <strong>SymfonyWorld Online 2020</strong>,
the first conference held entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he delivered
a masterclass on the new Symfony security system introduced in version 5.x
(<a href="https://live.symfony.com/account/replay/video/523" class="reference external">watch it here</a>).</p>
<p>And if you'd like travel back to where it all began, don't miss his very first
recorded Symfony conference talk at <strong>SymfonyCon Warsaw 2013</strong>, a front-end session
that captured the spirit of a young but already brilliant teacher
(<a href="https://live.symfony.com/account/replay/video/11" class="reference external">watch it here</a>).</p>
<p>These are just a few highlights of Ryan's remarkable contributions on stage,
now available for everyone to watch. We encourage you to revisit them, to smile,
to learn, and to feel the passion he poured into every word:</p>

<p>Through his talks, Ryan continues to teach us, not only about Symfony, but about
joy, creativity, and community. Thank you, Ryan. We'll keep learning from you.</p>
