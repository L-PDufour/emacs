<html><head></head><body>It is not astonishing at all that many people (including me) use Dired as their main file manager. The default look of Dired – just the output of ls -l – is deceptively crude, but underneath there is an immense power. Many Dired commands are just frontends to GNU Coreutils, but with much improved user interface, like reasonable default arguments (accessible via the “future history” of the minibuffer). But Dired is more than just a wrapper around Coreutils. For example, it has the dired-show-file-type command (bound to y by default), which runs the file command on the file at point. The file command is a great way to learn the basic information about any file. Besides telling the filetype, it often provides some information about its contents. For example, it guesses the encoding of text files and shows the resolution of image files. There are some information it does not give, however.</body></html>
