<p>Today I'm releasing git-annex 10.20230626. This release got delayed for 2
months due to making some breaking changes in how filenames with unusual
characters are quoted. So it has an unsual amount of changes in it, and is
as major as a git-annex release gets without being a repository version
bump.</p>

<p>But I mostly wanted to announce that we are planning a joint git-annex/Datalad meeting!
In the first half of 2024, probably in Germany. If you would be interested in
attending, please fill out this
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0PVLyzicTnAIz8dN7PrT8runUl2W9QxSWCzZoEW3x5bD9lA/viewform">brief survey</a>.
While Datalad is aimed at scientists, and I look forward to spending time
with them, you do not have to be a scientist to attend, any interested
users are welcome.</p>

<p>Also, if you'd like to learn about git-annex in Germany this weekend,
Yann BÃ¼chau is hosting a
<a href="https://cfp.tuebix.org/tuebix-2023/talk/review/GWRP3UKE3VFKVDG8RNQ8ZZPCZPNZYYWM">workshop</a>.</p>
