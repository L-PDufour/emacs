James Cherti, the author of <a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/inhibit-mouse.el">inhibit-mouse</a>, has a <a href="https://www.jamescherti.com/emacs-inhibit-mouse-disable-mouse/">blog post that talks about the package</a>. Irreal <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13286">wrote about the package last week</a> but you may enjoy learning a little bit more about it first hand from its author.
</p>
<p>
Cherti discusses why you might want to disable the mouse and why he believes that inhibit-mouse is a better solution than the <a href="https://github.com/purcell/disable-mouse">disable-mouse package</a>. The majority of his post explains how to configure the package: it turns out that it&rsquo;s <i>very</i> configurable. The information in Cherti&rsquo;s blog post is much the same as the README on his <a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/inhibit-mouse.el">GitHub respository for the package</a> so you can read either one.
</p>
<p>
As I said last week, it&rsquo;s <i>really</i> easy to generate unintended mouse actions especially if you&rsquo;re working on a laptop with a trackpad. Inhibit-mouse is an easy way of preventing that and helping you wean yourself from Emacs mouse usage.
</p>
<p>
Despite what you read here on Irreal and elsewhere, there isn&rsquo;t really anything wrong with using a mouse with Emacs or any other app but if you prefer not to or, if like me, you find yourself making inadvertent mouse clicks, inhibit-mouse or disable-mouse are fairly easy ways to solve the problem.
