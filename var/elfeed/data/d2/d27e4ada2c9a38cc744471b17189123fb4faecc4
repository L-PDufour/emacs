<html><head></head><body><p>It's been well over a year now since I've moved most of my music consumption away from streaming. I started purchasing music again, just so I can play offline at any time (and on my terms). That's not so say I don't stream, but that's now purely reserved for discovery. Most playback happens via <a href="https://xenodium.com/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode">Ready Player Mode</a>, a little Emacs player I built when I decided to take playback offline. This post isn't so much about <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player">Ready Player</a> and more about a recent <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html">dired</a> experience.</p>
<p>I had a directory with a handful of mp3s, which I wanted to split into separate album subdirectories. The challenge being the mp3 file names did not include album names. Sorting this out isn't a big task for a music-organization tool, but my brain quickly went hmmmâ€¦ if dired displayed album metadata, I could just use that to quickly guide me through all the file management I needed. After all, I already know how to use <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html">ffprobe</a> to extract relevant metadata, so I could just enhance dired's listing to also show me metadata as overlays. <a href="https://github.com/clemera/dired-git-info">dired-git-info</a> does just that.</p>
<p>With that, <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player/blob/main/ready-player-dired.el">ready-player-dired-mode</a> was born. After enabling with <code>M-x ready-player-dired-mode</code>, I can easily get on with my tiny file reorg <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">without any procrastination whatsoever</a>.</p>

<p>I've just pushed <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player/blob/main/ready-player-dired.el">ready-player-dired-mode</a> to <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player">Ready Player's GitHub repo</a>. It's pretty fresh, so you may (or may not) encounter rough edges.</p>
