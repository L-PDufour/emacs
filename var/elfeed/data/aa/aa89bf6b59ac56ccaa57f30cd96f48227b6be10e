<p>This package lets you preview a font inside of Emacs. It does so in
three ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prompt for a font on the system and display it in a buffer.</li>
  <li>List all known fonts in a buffer, with a short preview for each.</li>
  <li>Provide a major mode to preview a font whose file is among the
installed ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.3.0 on 2025-04-26</h2>

<p>This version adds some refinements to an already stable package.</p>

<h3>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-list</code> is an alias for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-tabulated</code></h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-list</code> command was using a custom buffer that listed
font families and their corresponding short preview. It did not have
any other feature.</p>

<p>I made changes under the hood to rely on the built-in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tabulated-list-mode</code> which is a standard and gives us the option to
sort by column. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-list</code> is thus an alias for the new
command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-tabulated</code>. Right now the sorting facility only
applies to reversing the name-based order. In the future we may have
more columns, such as if we describe a font as “Latin”, “Greek”, etc.</p>

<h3>The tabulated list marks fonts that cannot be previewed</h3>

<p>In the past, the font listing would include families that could not
display the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-pangram</code> or, indeed, any Latin character. Those
would be rendered as empty boxes.</p>

<p>I have now introduced a simple heuristic to test that the given family
supports Latin characters. If it does not, then (i) it is highlighted
with a different colour, (ii) it shows “No preview” instead of the
pangram, and (iii) it displays the information in the Emacs default
font family. Some families do not play nice with this approach though,
as they pass the test but still do not display any Latin characters.
This happens with icon fonts.</p>

<p>The long-term goal is to support different scripts and show the
appropriate text for each of them.</p>

<h3>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-sentences-sample</code> adds more to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-select-preview</code></h3>

<p>The new user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-sentences-sample</code> is a list of strings
that can be used to exhibit common patterns and letter combinations.
The default value is carefully designed to show if a font family is
stylistically consistent, such as with how it draws <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code>, or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code>, and so on. Plus, it teaches you some obscure words like
“scholarch”, “antipode”, and “heteroclite”: use them with your Greek
friends—and if they do not know those words, then they must buy you
a café frappé!</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The face <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-title-small</code> is an obsolete alias for the more
appropriately named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-title-in-listing</code>.</li>
  <li>The prompt used by the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-select-preview</code> now
correctly uses its own history and default value.</li>
  <li>The default value of the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-character-sample</code>
includes some more patterns to better test the adequacy of a font
family. This sample is displayed in the buffer produced by the
command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-select-preview</code>.</li>
</ul>
