Over at the OrgRoam subreddit, thephatmaster asks for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OrgRoam/comments/1nv4qey/workflow_suggestions_for_pulling_together_writing/">some help in using org-roam to organize and write his research</a>. As of this writing, he hasn&rsquo;t gotten much response but there is a comment that recommends he take a look at <a href="https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion?tab=readme-ov-file">org-transclusion</a>. I hadn&rsquo;t heard of it so I took a look.

The idea is that you can include content from another file in an org document by means of a link. It&rsquo;s sort of like a <code># INCLUDE:</code> but a bit more flexible. You can, for example, make changes in the destination file and have them reflected back to the source file.

You can also specify which lines you want from the source file and have only those imported. There&rsquo;s also a nice integration with code blocks that the author, nobiot, talks about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueaPiA622wA">this video</a> (9 minutes, 45 seconds).

This looks like a mature package that&rsquo;s been around for at least 4 years and is still be maintained with the last update 9 months ago. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://nobiot.github.io/org-transclusion/">comprehensive manual</a> available online as well as an info file. The software is available from GNU ELPA and so is easy to install.

This seems like a really good package that can help organize research and serve as a way of reusing research notes. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion?tab=readme-ov-file">GitHub repository</a> for a list of ways you can use it.</p>
