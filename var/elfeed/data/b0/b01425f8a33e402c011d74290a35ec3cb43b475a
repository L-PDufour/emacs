<html><head></head><body>A few months ago I mentioned Artist mode. It seems that at least one person liked that post enough to mention it (thanks!), even if indirectly. That very post also mentioned svg-clock, which is a cute analog clock displayed directly in Emacs. Of course, my immediate thought was, why not create an ASCII-art analog clock using Artist mode?</body></html>
