<p>The qooxdoo Open Source project is going to see some significant advancements.</p><p>For quite a while now we have been talking about the intention to open up the project to facilitate more community involvement. 1&amp;1 as qooxdoo’s initiator has started and is supporting this transformation. As the opportunity is actively being pursued, we would like to announce where we stand right now.</p><p>In order to allow for a best possible transformation of the project, we wanted this to be driven by people who have been involved with the qooxdoo project for a long time, have been providing first-class contributions to it and have an expert knowledge of its technology. Ideally, they should have a track record of running Open Source projects successfully as well as knowing about the specific needs of a professional, business-oriented community such as qooxdoo’s. Knowing such people in person and trusting them wouldn’t hurt either.</p><p>We’re glad that the ones we approached — encompassing all of above requirements perfectly — agreed to take up the opportunity to evolve the qooxdoo project: long-time qooxdoo fellows Fritz Zaucker and Tobi Oetiker joined to coordinate and drive the upcoming changes and improvements.</p><p>Moreover, others we asked for their close collaboration are also on-board, e.g. Cajus Pollmeier, Derrell Lipman, Dietrich Streifert, John Spackman. Given the recent activities of various people on the mailing list there is much additional momentum.</p><p>Actually, we had hoped to announce both plan and completion of this entire process by the end of 2015. But a few administrative hurdles are still being worked on. With 1&amp;1, a great supporter of Open Source and qooxdoo in particular, some necessary steps are being taken to ensure the organizational and legal aspects are properly addressed:</p><p>1) As previously <a href="/license-update">announced</a> the current dual-licensing (LGPL/EPL) will be simplified and future releases are expected to be under the MIT license.</p><p>2) We founded a legal entity called “qooxdoo.org” as a non-profit association after Swiss law (named a “Verein” in German).</p><p>3) 1&amp;1 is going to transfer the intellectual property rights and the qooxdoo.org internet domain to the qooxdoo.org association.</p><p>4) The ownership of the qooxdoo organization at <a href="https://github.com/qooxdoo">Github</a> and thus the official code repository will also be transferred.</p><p>5) The qooxdoo hosting infrastructure (homepage, blog, bugzilla, etc.) is to be replaced, by public infrastructure and services such as GitHub, etc. wherever possible.</p><p>With the new freedom there will also be more responsibility for the community. While 1&amp;1 developers might continue to contribute to qooxdoo as their job responsibilities permit, the driving force behind the project will be <em>you</em>, the experts and collaborators right within the community. qooxdoo will now depend on <em>your</em> contributions (ideas, code, infrastructure, money, etc) and benefit from <em>your</em> engagement.</p><p>We have seen a number of qooxdoo-based projects being discussed on the mailing list in the past. And we know of a few other projects using qooxdoo as key element that are not publicly visible. Let’s bundle our resources to make qooxdoo even better. As there are so many talented and enthusiastic qooxdoo users this transformation is going to succeed. The qooxdoo.org association will provide the vessel for this endeavour.</p><p>At this point we would like to thank 1&amp;1 for the tremendous effort put into this framework over all those years, and moreover, for the generosity to make it available as an Open Source project since early 2005 and now allowing qooxdoo to be further evolved by a grown-up community.</p><p>We will let you know once the administrative steps are completed. In the meantime please feel free to send any of your comments/suggestions/pledges.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Andreas, Fritz, Tobi and supporters</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=48cf7837f56b" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://news.qooxdoo.org/evolving-the-qooxdoo-project-48cf7837f56b">Evolving the qooxdoo Project</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.qooxdoo.org">Qooxdoo News</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
