<a

of the Radicle peer-to-peer Git collaboration platform has been
released. This release includes better support for bare repositories,
structured logging, and improvements in the output of <tt>rad patch
show</tt>:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
The previous output would differentiate "updates", where the original
author creates a new revision, and "revisions", where another author
creates a revision. This could be confusing since updates are also
revisions. Instead, the output shows a timeline of the root of the
patch and each new revision, without any differentiation. The revision
identifiers, head commit of the revision, and author are still printed
as per usual.
