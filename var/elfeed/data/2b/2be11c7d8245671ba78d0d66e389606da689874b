Godot already has some support for Emacs with <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/emacs-gdscript-mode">gdscript-mode</a>, but I really dream of being able to control the whole editor from within Emacs directly - never leaving it except maybe for more precise level design.

So, that's what I've been working on. Using copious <code>magit-section</code> and a bunch of extremely crappy, poorly formatted Elisp, I'm starting to make my dream a reality.

You can see a video demo of the current functionality here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BimnzXjA0DA">video demo</a>.

It's quite bare-bones at the moment, and doesn't support a lot of things that are probably necessary for this to be of any serious use. My plan is to "eat my own dogfood" with this and add things as I want them. Contributions are always welcome, and the code is available <a href="https://git.cyan.sh/BirDt/godot-remote-control">here</a>.
