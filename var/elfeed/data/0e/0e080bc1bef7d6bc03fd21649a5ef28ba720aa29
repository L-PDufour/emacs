<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/flymake-ansible-lint.el">flymake-ansible-lint</a> package provides a Flymake backend for ansible-lint, enabling real-time syntax and style checking for Ansible playbooks and roles within Emacs.</p>
<p><em>(This package can also work with Flycheck: simply use the <code>flymake-flycheck</code> package, which allows any Emacs Flymake backend to function as a Flycheck checker.)</em></p>
