<p>On Sunday, the 11th of May 2025, at 14:00 o’clock of time zone
Europe/Athens, I will do a live stream where I will answer every
question posted in the chat. The idea is to cover any of the topics I
already write/talk about on my website, including Emacs, my recently
published “Emacs Lisp Elements” free book, libre software, politics,
philosophy, and everyday affairs.</p>

<p>I will answer every question from top to bottom to the best of my
abilities and will not give any of those formulaic non-answers. No
tricks; no gimmicks!</p>

<p>The plan is to do a minimum of two hours, but may extend it for at
least one or two more hours depending on the participation in the
chat.</p>

<p>The event will be recorded: no worries if you cannot make it live.</p>

<p>Talk to all of you soon!</p>
