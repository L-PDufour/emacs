<p>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More here:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/prot-asks/">https://protesilaos.com/prot-asks/</a>.</p>

<p>Today I talk with Erik Arneson about a number of topics ranging from
Emacs to how life in Portland and Oregon is, to podcasting and
relevant tooling, and to how regular users deal with word processors.
We start the chat with the theme of providing software services and
how it relates to the open source experience. Erik tells me about the
aesthetics of the Go programming language and how it compares to
coding in Lisp. Then Erik tells the story of how it all started with
Emacs some time in the 1990s, before Linux was available. I ask how
was Emacs back in the day and how things developed over time. Our
discussion explores life in Oregon and its largest city, Portland. We
tie it all together with Emacs and specific workflows and tools of it.
The final part covers Erik’s endeavours with podcasting and the
relevant technicalities, including nerdy stuff like writing music with
a Lisp engine.</p>

<p>We had some technical issues with the connection as well as with my
audio input. Apologies for that!</p>
