If you had a look at our <a href="https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo">github repository</a> recently, you may have noticed though that there is plenty of life. Here are the recent developments:</p><ul><li>In 2015, 1&amp;1 Internet Inc., the company who has been developing qooxdoo since 2006, has changed their tooling strategy and has stopped investing in further qooxdoo development.</li><li>The qooxdoo.org association has been founded with the objective to guide and organize the further development of the qooxdoo framework. All major contributors outside of 1&amp;1 have since joined the new association.</li><li>1&amp;1 has signed a release to hand over control of the qooxdoo.org domain to the qooxdoo.org association.</li><li>1&amp;1 has re-licensed all the code and documentation they contributed to qooxdoo under an MIT license.</li><li>All repositories have been moved to a public infrastructure.</li></ul><p>Since early 2016 the people interested in qooxdoo have been gathering on <a href="https://gitter.im/qooxdoo/qooxdoo">gitter</a> to organize work and agree on strategy. All the while we have been busy merging pull requests both for bug fixes as well as for new features.</p><p>We are working on several projects, some of them have already been merged, some still exist as Pull Requests, and others are in separate repositories. Expect to see individual articles on some of these developments over the course of the next few weeks:</p><ul><li>automatic testing and coverage reporting via Travis CI and Coveralls.</li><li>a blazingly fast new compiler for qooxdoo projects written in JavaScript.</li><li>font icons support for <a href="http://www.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/#qx.ui.basic.Image">qx.ui.basic.Image</a>.</li><li>a visual theme editor.</li><li>a new Material Design inspired default theme.</li><li>much simplified garbage collection.</li><li>support for promises.</li><li>support for Java-style annotations.</li></ul><p>We are currently preparing a bug fix release due out in the next few weeks.
