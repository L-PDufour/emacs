<p>The <strong><a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/inhibit-mouse.el">inhibit-mouse</a></strong> package allows the disabling of mouse input in Emacs using <code>inhibit-mouse-mode</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of modifying the keymap of its own mode as the <em>disable-mouse</em> package does, enabling inhibit-mouse-mode only modifies input-decode-map to disable mouse events, making it more efficient and faster than <em>disable-mouse</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <em>inhibit-mouse</em> package allows for the restoration of mouse input when <code>inhibit-mouse-mode</code> is disabled.</p>
<p>If this enhances your workflow, please show your support by <strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐"> starring inhibit-mouse on GitHub</strong> to help more Emacs users discover its benefits.</p>

## Customization

### Customizing the mouse buttons disabled by inhibit-mouse?

The *inhibit-mouse* custom variables allow you to fine-tune which mouse interactions are disabled.

You can use the following configuration to specify which mouse buttons and events you want to disable:
``` emacs-lisp
;; This variable specifies which mouse buttons should be inhibited from
;; triggering events.
(setq inhibit-mouse-button-numbers '(1 2 3 4 5))

;; List of mouse button events to be inhibited.
(setq inhibit-mouse-button-events '("mouse"
                                    "up-mouse"
                                    "down-mouse"
                                    "drag-mouse"))

;; List of miscellaneous mouse events to be inhibited.
(setq inhibit-mouse-misc-events '("wheel-up"
                                  "wheel-down"
                                  "wheel-left"
                                  "wheel-right"
                                  "pinch"))

;; List of mouse multiplier events to be inhibited.
(setq inhibit-mouse-multipliers '("double" "triple"))

;; List of key modifier combinations to be inhibited for mouse events.
(setq inhibit-mouse-key-modifiers '((control)
                                    (meta)
                                    (shift)
                                    (control meta shift)
                                    (control meta)
                                    (control shift)
                                    (meta shift)))</code></pre>
<h3>Enabling/Disabling the context menu</h3>
<p>To enable or disable the context menu based on the state of <code>inhibit-mouse-mode</code>, the following code dynamically toggles <code>context-menu-mode</code> accordingly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elisp">(add-hook 'inhibit-mouse-mode-hook
          #'(lambda()
              ;; Enable or disable the context menu based on the state of
              ;; `inhibit-mouse-mode', the following code dynamically toggles
              ;; `context-menu-mode' accordingly.
              (when (fboundp 'context-menu-mode)
                (if (bound-and-true-p inhibit-mouse-mode)
                    (context-menu-mode -1)
                  (context-menu-mode 1)))))</code></pre>
<p>This ensures that the context menu is disabled when <code>inhibit-mouse-mode</code> is active and enabled when it is inactive.</p>
<h3>Enabling/Disabling tooltip-mode</h3>
<p>When <code>tooltip-mode</code> is enabled, Emacs displays certain UI hints (e.g., help text and mouse-hover messages) as popup windows near the cursor, instead of in the echo area. This behavior is useful in graphical Emacs sessions.</p>
<p>To toggle <code>tooltip-mode</code> dynamically based on the state of <code>inhibit-mouse-mode</code>, you can use the following hook:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elisp">(add-hook 'inhibit-mouse-mode-hook
          #'(lambda()
              ;; Enable or disable `tooltip-mode'. When tooltip-mode is
              ;; enabled, certain UI elements (e.g., help text, mouse-hover
              ;; hints) will appear as native system tooltips (pop-up
              ;; windows), rather than as echo area messages. This is useful
              ;; in graphical Emacs sessions where tooltips can appear near
              ;; the cursor.
              (when (fboundp 'tooltip-mode)
                (if (bound-and-true-p inhibit-mouse-mode)
                    (tooltip-mode -1)
                  (tooltip-mode 1)))))</code></pre>
<h3>Enabling/disabling pixel scroll precision mode</h3>
<p>The following configuration toggles <code>pixel-scroll-precision-mode</code> based on the state of <code>inhibit-mouse-mode</code>, excluding macOS Carbon environments where pixel scrolling is natively supported and does not require explicit activation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elisp">(add-hook 'inhibit-mouse-mode-hook
          #'(lambda()
              (unless (and
                       ;; Exclude macOS Carbon environments where pixel
                       ;; scrolling is natively supported and does not
                       ;; require explicit activation.
                       (eq window-system 'mac)
                       (bound-and-true-p mac-carbon-version-string))
                (when (fboundp 'pixel-scroll-precision-mode)
                  (if (bound-and-true-p inhibit-mouse-mode)
                      (pixel-scroll-precision-mode -1)
                    (pixel-scroll-precision-mode 1))))))</code></pre>
<h2>Frequently Asked Question</h2>
<h3>What motivates the author to disable the mouse in Emacs?</h3>
<p>The author disables the mouse in Emacs:</p>
<ul>
<li>To prevent accidental clicks or cursor movements that can change the cursor position unexpectedly.</li>
<li>To reinforce a keyboard-centric workflow, helping to avoid the habit of relying on the mouse for navigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some may suggest that the author could modify the touchpad settings at the OS level. However, he prefers not to disable the touchpad entirely, as it remains useful in other applications, such as web browsers.</p>
<h3>Is it not enough to simply avoid touching the mouse?</h3>
<p>It is not always as simple as just deciding not to touch the mouse. When transitioning to a fully keyboard-driven workflow, existing habits can be surprisingly persistent.</p>
<p>In the author’s case, he often found himself unconsciously reaching for the mouse, even though they had deliberately chosen to keep his hands on the home row. The home row, the middle row of keys on a standard keyboard layout, is where the fingers rest in the touch typing method. Keeping the hands on the home row minimizes unnecessary hand movement, preserves typing rhythm, and allows immediate access to the majority of keys. In contrast, reaching for the mouse interrupts the workflow, introduces delays, and shifts focus away from the keyboard, reducing overall efficiency.</p>
<p>The <em>inhibit-mouse</em> Emacs package provided a practical solution. By disabling mouse input entirely, it removed the possibility of falling back on that habit. Over time, this enforced constraint trained the author to rely exclusively on the keyboard.</p>
<p>This package acted as a form of behavioral reinforcement for the author: each attempt to use the mouse proved unproductive, gradually reshaping habits until the keyboard-driven workflow became natural and automatic.</p>
<h3>What is the difference between the disable-mouse and inhibit-mouse packages?</h3>
<p>The <em>inhibit-mouse</em> package is a efficient alternative to the <em>disable-mouse</em> package, as it only modifies <em>input-decode-map</em> to disable mouse events.</p>
<p>In contrast, <em>disable-mouse</em> applies mouse events to its own mode, and sometimes the user has to apply it to other modes that are not affected by the <em>disable-mouse</em> mode using the <code>disable-mouse-in-keymap</code> function (e.g, evil-mode, tab-bar…).</p>
<p>Additionally, <em>inhibit-mouse</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows re-enabling mouse functionality when the mode is disabled, which is not supported by <em>disable-mouse</em> when the <code>disable-mouse-in-keymap</code> function is used. The <code>disable-mouse-in-keymap</code> function overwrites the key mappings of other modes (e.g., evil, tab-bar), and there is no straightforward way to make <em>disable-mouse</em> restore them.</li>
<li>It resolves issues that <em>disable-mouse</em> does not, such as the “C-c C-x  is not bound” problem, where the user intended to enter C-c C-x j but accidentally touched the touchpad.</li>
</ul>
<p>This concept of utilizing <code>input-decode-map</code> to disable the mouse was introduced by Stefan Monnier in an emacs-devel mailing list <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-11/msg00013.html">thread</a> initiated by Daniel Radetsky, who proposed a patch to the Emacs developers. Additionally, here is an interesting discussion on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/9229">Add recipe for inhibit-mouse</a>.</p>
