<p>The <em>Emacs Writing Studio</em> (EWS) by Peter Prevos is a configuration
for Emacs designed for writers, researchers, and scientists. It
provides an integrated environment to express one’s thoughts and
publish them in multiple formats. The book, which is produced using
EWS, documents the setup, describes relevant methods or workflows, and
explains how everything is pieced together. I contributed the foreword.</p>

<p>This morning, I got the paperback version of the book. It is a thing
of beauty!</p>

<p>Thanks to Peter for working on this and for showing how Emacs can also
be used as a professional publishing tool.</p>
