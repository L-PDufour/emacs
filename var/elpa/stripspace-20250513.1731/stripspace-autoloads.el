;;; stripspace-autoloads.el --- automatically extracted autoloads (do not edit)   -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;; Generated by the `loaddefs-generate' function.

;; This file is part of GNU Emacs.

(autoload 'stripspace-cleanup "stripspace" "\
Delete trailing whitespace in the current buffer or region." t)
(autoload 'stripspace-local-mode "stripspace" "\
Toggle `stripspace-local-mode'.

This mode ensures that trailing whitespace is removed before saving a buffer.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Stripspace-Local mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate the variable `stripspace-local-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is
disabled.

Non-nil if Stripspace-Global mode is enabled.
See the `stripspace-global-mode' command
for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `stripspace-global-mode'.")

(autoload 'stripspace-global-mode "stripspace" "\
Toggle Stripspace-Local mode in all buffers.
With prefix ARG, enable Stripspace-Global mode if ARG is positive; otherwise,
disable it.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.
Enable the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

Stripspace-Local mode is enabled in all buffers where
`stripspace--global-mode-maybe-enable' would do it.

See `stripspace-local-mode' for more information on Stripspace-Local mode.
